    <h2>
      CHAPTER I&mdash;THE ETERNAL FEMININE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;I</span> F you are coming
      my way, Goddard, we may as well walk back together,&rdquo; said the Member,
      putting on his fur-lined coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Aloysius Gleam, member for Sunington, was a spare, precisely dressed
      little man on the hither side of forty. He was somewhat bald, and
      clean-shaven all to a tightly-screwed fair moustache. A gold-rimmed
      eye-glass added a quaint air of alertness to a shrewd, sharp-featured
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard acquiesced readily, although on this particular evening his road
      lay in a different direction. But democrat though he was, he felt
      flattered by Mr. Gleam&rsquo;s friendly proposal. He was young&mdash;eight and
      twenty, a cabinetmaker by trade, self-taught and consequently
      self-opinionated, yet humble enough before evident superiority of
      knowledge or experience. Besides, in coming to take the chair at his
      lecture on The New Trades Unionism, before the Sunington Radical Club, the
      Member had paid him a decided compliment. A member of Parliament has many
      pleasanter and more profitable ways of spending a precious spare evening
      during a busy session.
    </p>
    <p>
      They formed a singular contrast as they stood side by side in the little
      knot of committee-men who had remained behind after the audience had left.
      Goddard was above the middle height, squarely built, deep-chested,
      large-limbed; his decent workman&rsquo;s clothes hung loosely upon him. His
      features were dark and massive, chin and forehead square, nose somewhat
      fleshy, mouth shutting stubbornly with folds at the sides; the lip, on
      which, like the rest of his face, no hair grew, rather long; altogether it
      was a powerful face, showing a nature capable of strong passions both for
      good and evil. The accident of straight black hair generally falling
      across his forehead, and a humorous setting of his eyes, relieved the face
      of harshness. At the present moment it was alive with the frankness of
      youth, and flushed with the success that had attended his lecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group walked slowly down the hall through the chairs, and lingered for
      a moment at the clubhouse door. It was a new quarter of London. Mr.
      Aloysius Gleam had lived in the neighbourhood most of his life, and had
      seen it spring up from fields and market-gardens into a bustling town,
      with arteries fed from the life-stream of Oxford Street and the Strand.
      Its development had been dear to him. There was strong local feeling, and
      he was deservedly popular. It was therefore some time before he could
      break away from his supporters. At last he did so, and started with
      Goddard at a brisk pace up the High Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been wondering,&rdquo; he said, after a short silence, &ldquo;whether you
      would care to take to politics seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m playing at it,&rdquo; replied Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! don&rsquo;t be so confoundedly touchy,&rdquo; said Gleam good-humouredly. &ldquo;By
      &lsquo;seriously&rsquo; I meant entirely, professionally. Would you like to devote all
      your time to the work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think I would,&rdquo; replied Goddard quickly; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t. I have my
      bread and butter to earn. I don&rsquo;t quite see why you ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you accept a position if your bread and butter were assured to
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a paid agitator? Oh no, thanks! I couldn&rsquo;t stand that. Work of that
      sort must be given, not sold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rubbish,&rdquo; said the Member lightly. &ldquo;The labourer is worthy of his
      hire. The notion is as cranky as Tolstoi&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Goddard. &ldquo;The paid agitator is a fraud. He pretends to be
      a working-man and he isn&rsquo;t. When I address a crowd I can say, &lsquo;I am one of
      yourselves, the real thing. I belong to the Amalgamated Union of
      Cabinetmakers, and earn my forty bob a week with the work of my hands.&rsquo;
      Men listen to me, and respect me. What I could not swallow would be for a
      fellow to get up and tell me, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all very well for you to talk; but
      you&rsquo;re paid for talking, and make a jolly good thing of it. Instead of
      helping the working-man, you are simply growing fat on the working-man&rsquo;s
      hard-earned money.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve heard that said to paid agitators myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who said I wanted you to become a paid agitator?&rdquo; asked Gleam. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t want you to stand on a barrel and address people as
      &lsquo;fellow-sufferers.&rsquo; You are a cut above that kind of thing. What I wanted
      to propose to you was work on our new National Progressive League. Of
      course, scores of men are giving their services; but they are men of a
      certain amount of leisure. They can afford it. The working-man has no
      leisure to speak of, and we would give anything for the services of a few
      well-educated, clearheaded working-men like yourself. We could manage
      three pounds a week&mdash;perhaps more. Well, there&rsquo;s a chance for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goddard walked on a few steps in silence. He was young, earnest, a
      passionate champion of the great questions on the Progressive programme.
      He felt in himself a power to grip the attention of men. He had dreamed
      vague dreams of personal ambition. Gleam&rsquo;s offer was a great temptation.
      But the consciousness that it was a temptation made him adhere all the
      more obstinately to his principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;and I am flattered by your opinion
      of me. But I shouldn&rsquo;t feel justified in giving up my trade: it wouldn&rsquo;t
      seem right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do as you like, my good fellow,&rdquo; replied the Member cheerily. &ldquo;But
      I think you&rsquo;re a bit of an idiot. You&rsquo;ll find a thousand first-rate
      cabinetmakers for one competent politician. Anyhow, if you change your
      mind&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like changing my mind,&rdquo; returned Goddard, with a laugh, &ldquo;as if it
      were a shirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are none of us infallible, not even the youngest,&rdquo; quoted the Member
      below his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, taking a broad view of youth, he forbore to rebuke the young man, and
      turned the conversation upon certain points in the recently delivered
      lecture. When he reached his turning he shook hands and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard looked at his watch, and gave a little whistle of dismay. An
      omnibus from the west lumbered up. Goddard climbed on to the roof, and
      returned down the High Street. At the &ldquo;Golden Stag,&rdquo; where the &rsquo;bus
      route ended, he descended, and proceeded almost at a run down some side
      streets and lanes, and eventually knocked at a door in a row of workmen&rsquo;s
      cottages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> late,&rdquo; said a girl who opened the door to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      been waiting with my &rsquo;at on for the last three-quarters of an hour.
      No; you ain&rsquo;t going to kiss me. If you&rsquo;d wanted to do that, you&rsquo;d have
      found your way here before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come as fast as I could, Lizzie,&rdquo; said the young man, somewhat out
      of breath. &ldquo;But I went back part of the way with Mr. Gleam, who wanted to
      speak to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very fine,&rdquo; said Lizzie. &ldquo;But I think I count for something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led the way into a little front room, where a couple of girls were
      busy with dressmaking. One of them was bending over a sewing-machine. Bits
      of stuff and patterns littered the table. A few spotted fashion-plates
      adorned the walls. The air was heavy with the smell of new mercery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Dan at last!&rdquo; said Lizzie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a case of how d&rsquo;ye do and
      good-bye. These are my two cousins. This one&rsquo;s Emily, and that&rsquo;s Sophie.
      Oh, look at the clock! It <i>is</i> a shaime!&rdquo; Goddard shook hands with
      the two cousins of his affianced&mdash;pale, anemic girls, who giggled a
      little, while Lizzie saw to the straightness of her hat in the gilt mirror
      over the mantelpiece. When that was done, she admired herself for a
      moment. She was pretty&mdash;with the devil&rsquo;s prettiness; fluffy fair
      hair, a pink complexion and small, watery blue eyes&mdash;a poetic but
      discarded admirer had termed them &ldquo;liquid azure,&rdquo; which had pleased her
      mightily. Her mouth had a ripe way of pouting that took the edge off tart
      speeches, at any-rate in a lover&rsquo;s opinion, but otherwise it was loose and
      devoid of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let him stop to talk,&rdquo; she said, turning to her cousins.
      &ldquo;Father&rsquo;ll be in an awful stew. I&rsquo;ll bring him round another day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said Emily, the elder of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course I will,&rdquo; said Goddard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very pleased to make your
      acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was feeling, somewhat abashed amid these feminine surroundings, and
      laughed awkwardly. When the door closed behind Lizzie and himself he was
      relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are not vexed with me, Lizzie,&rdquo; he said humbly. &ldquo;I really did
      not know it was so late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use talking about it,&rdquo; said Lizzie in an injured tone. &ldquo;But just
      let me keep you waiting, and see how you&rsquo;d like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, after a time, Lizzie was mollified, and in token thereof drew
      Daniel&rsquo;s arm, correctly loverwise, within her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lecture was a great success,&rdquo; he said at length. &ldquo;Many more people
      than I had expected. I wish you had been there. Only they don&rsquo;t admit
      ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it about? Politics, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;broadly speaking. Strictly it was on the New Trades Unionism. I
      traced its development, you know, showing how the spirit has changed. The
      Old Trades Unions were intensely jealous of State interference, because
      they looked upon the Government as the natural enemy of labour. But now
      labour is a powerful element in the State, and means to legislate for
      itself, and so make State-control the very bulwark of its rights. Of
      course I went into all kinds of details, but that was the general run of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been awfully clever,&rdquo; said Lizzie, without much enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; laughed the young man. &ldquo;I was a little nervous at
      first. You see I have spoken often enough, both at the club and in the open
      air, and then the words come naturally. You get warmed up, you know, and
      you let them have it straight. But this is the first time I&rsquo;ve given a set
      lecture in cold blood, where everything has got to be expressed in chosen
      language&mdash;but it went very well. Mr. Gleam told me I was quite
      academic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a great swell, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; asked Lizzie. &ldquo;Drives his carriage and
      pair, and lives in the big house with the griffins on the front gates. And
      you walked back with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to the top of the street,&rdquo; replied Goddard, still sounding an
      apologetic note. &ldquo;He wanted to ask me whether I would throw up the
      workshop and become a paid agent of the National Progressive League.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how nice!&rdquo; said Lizzie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was nice of him,&rdquo; replied Goddard; &ldquo;but, of course, I declined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Daniel! How could you? It would have been so much more genteel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word jarred upon him. It set the matter in a new light, and made it
      look very ugly. Besides, it afforded him a not very satisfactory peep into
      Lizzie&rsquo;s spiritual horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind my being a working-man, do you, Lizzie?&rdquo; he asked, with
      some reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind. What&rsquo;s the odds? We needn&rsquo;t trouble about it. If you like
      to wear a dirty apron and have your &rsquo;ands all covered over with
      varnish and turpentine, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tossed her head, and drew a little away from him, so that only his
      fingers touched her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we need discuss that,&rdquo; said Goddard stiffly&mdash;&ldquo;unless
      you think I am not good enough for you. In that case you might as well
      tell me at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re unkind,&rdquo; said Lizzie.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked a few steps in silence, and then Lizzie pulled out a
      pocket-handkerchief and dabbed her eyes. The young man&rsquo;s heart softened
      miraculously. He slid back his arm beneath hers, and drew her a little
      closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you, Liz. Indeed, I didn&rsquo;t. What can I do to say
      I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I don&rsquo;t care for you,&rdquo; whimpered Lizzie. &ldquo;Every one knows I
      gave up Joe Forster just for you; and he&rsquo;s got his own tobacco business
      and keeps an assistant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The main part of which statement was not exactly in accordance with facts.
      But Goddard was not in the current of local gossip, and did not suspect
      his sweetheart&rsquo;s veracity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll forgive me, and we&rsquo;ll make it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to break it off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Good gracious, no. Why, Liz!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another pause. They were in the middle of the High Street. Knots
      of loafers hung around the blazing entrances of the public-houses, but
      otherwise the pavement was more or less deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you put your arm round my waist, then?&rdquo; said Lizzie softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard did as he was bidden. She laughed out loud at his shy awkwardness,
      and pulled his fingers tighter round her figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One&rsquo;d say I was the only girl you&rsquo;d ever walked out with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are,&rdquo; replied Goddard simply. &ldquo;I never bothered much with girls
      till I knew you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that&rsquo;s a cracker,&rdquo; said Lizzie, who was beginning to enjoy the
      walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t, indeed. I swear it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! How can you? Well, if it&rsquo;s true it oughtn&rsquo;t to have been. You ought
      to have had some one to practise on, and then you would have learned to do
      things nicely. Practice makes perfect, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A light argument followed, which ended in Goddard&rsquo;s discomfiture, and left
      him with a vague feeling that he had missed one of the duties of man in
      letting his talent for lovemaking lie dormant, and also an uneasy wonder
      at the extent of Lizzie&rsquo;s familiarity with the subject. But Lizzie was
      quite happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t like any other girl, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rested her head slightly against him. The glare of an electric-lighted
      shop-front fell on her pretty, upturned face, and the young man forgot
      everything, save that she had soft puckered lips and young, even teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were reconciled as far as harmony was ever possible between their
      natures. The rest of the walk home was undisturbed, and when they arrived
      at Lizzie&rsquo;s door they were well pleased with each other. She opened the
      door with her latch-key and, holding it ajar, received his kiss prettily,
      and then with a desire to complete the reconciliation in all ways, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you decided to remain a workingman, Dan. I can&rsquo;t bear them silly
      politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She disappeared quickly. Dan remained for a moment looking vaguely at the
      knocker, as if to address it in confidential remonstrance; and then
      turning away, he let himself into the adjoining house, and slowly mounted
      the stairs to his room, with an all-pervading sense of the strange
      futility of the female mind.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;A REVOLUTION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>he was the one
      thing feminine that had come across his path. He had stared at it like a
      new Adam. His original Eden lay at the back of the houses, and was divided
      by a low wall. Here, first, he used to lean, in his shirt-sleeves, pipe in
      mouth, on the late summer evenings, and exchange remarks with her as she
      removed the washing from the clothes&rsquo; lines, or idly took the air. How he
      had drifted into his present relations he would have found it difficult to
      determine. It never occurred to him to do so, his mind being filled with
      other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees he had familiarised himself with the fact of her existence.
      Then it seemed natural that he should marry her. In his social sphere a
      wife formed a necessary part of everyday existence. And then she was the
      prettiest girl he had ever seen. When he kissed the pouting lips, all
      kinds of strange tinglings ran through him. That was proof positive of his
      being in love. So one day he called on her father, a retired captain of a
      Thames steamboat, and obtained his consent to the marriage. He was earning
      good wages, had even a little put by. The old man, whose tastes were not
      of a domestic order, and who found a daughter an expensive luxury, got
      solemnly drunk all by himself to celebrate the occasion. Goddard
      considered him an abandoned old ruffian, as soon as he came to know more
      about him, and conceiving a tender pity for Lizzie, longed to get her out
      of his clutches.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard work to carry on his trade, his self-education, his political
      pursuits, and his lovemaking, all at the same time. The last was
      distinctly pleasant, but it was sadly lacking in advantages from a
      utilitarian point of view. Until he had fallen in love with her over that
      back-garden wall, he had scouted the idea of &ldquo;messing about&rdquo; with girls as
      a criminal waste of precious hours Even now he felt somewhat guilty. He
      longed to be married, to settle down, to have Lizzie&rsquo;s pretty face at his
      fireside definitely assured to him for the rest of his days, and to see
      before him a peaceful, undisturbed stretch of years wherein to further
      with all his heart and energies the great movement in which he was
      absorbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Lizzie was right. A little previous practice in the art of love
      would have been for his good; but in a widely different sense from that
      which came within Lizzie&rsquo;s philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few evenings after he had given the lecture at the Radical Club, he took
      her to the theatre. Some weeks previously he had treated her to the
      Lyceum, not doubting in the guilelessness of his heart that her aesthetic
      appreciation would be as great as his own. But she had been bored to
      death, had come home cross, and the subject of play-going became a
      dangerous one. This time, however, by way of compensation, it was the
      Adelphi. Lizzie laughed and wept and squeezed Daniel&rsquo;s arm, and enjoyed
      herself amazingly. She did not know with whom she was the more delighted,
      Mr. William Terriss or Daniel. On the top of the homeward &rsquo;bus she
      decided in favour of Daniel. She nestled close to him on the garden-seat,
      and brought his arm round her. Then she drew off her well-worn glove, so
      as to put her bare hand in his. He was touched, tightened his circling
      arm, and bent down his head till the fluffy fair curls brushed his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you hug me oftener, Dan?&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Like this. It makes me
      feel much more homey with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not always on top of a &rsquo;bus,&rdquo; said Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a little nudge to show him that she appreciated his jest, but
      she went on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind your kissing me, Dan. I like it. Now we&rsquo;re engaged you ought
      to be awfully spoony, you know, and squeeze me, and tell me how lovely I
      look, and all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were on the front seat of the &rsquo;bus; the people behind did not
      count as spectators; the hurrying roadway and crowded pavement below were
      remote as the clear-shining stars above. Daniel surrendered to the coaxing
      murmur, and kissed her a long lover&rsquo;s kiss. When an inspector, a short
      time afterwards, demanded their tickets, Goddard forgot his Collectivist
      principles and became a fierce Individualist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a confounded nuisance&mdash;these fellows disturbing us! It oughtn&rsquo;t
      to be allowed,&rdquo; he said, resettling himself. And Lizzie acquiesced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of the journey they grew silent. Lizzie, tired, dozed with
      her head on his shoulder. A sudden jolt of the &lsquo;bus awakened her. She
      laughed, and rubbed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe I&rsquo;ve been asleep. What have you been doing all the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking,&rdquo; he replied, smiling at the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was thinking of my speech on Saturday in Hyde Park, you know.
      There is an Eight Hour demonstration, and the League people have asked me
      to take a platform. I&rsquo;m becoming quite an important person, you see, Liz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were going to say you&rsquo;d been thinking of me,&rdquo; said Lizzie,
      piqued. &ldquo;I call that beastly of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took him all the time until they parted to re-establish the &ldquo;spoony&rdquo;
       relations that alone, according to Lizzie, seemed to make for happiness
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he went to bed that night he found himself wondering for the
      first time whether his political interests might not cause serious
      friction between Lizzie and himself. To give them up was out of the
      question. Vague doubts came as to the wisdom of the step he was about to
      take.
    </p>
    <p>
      They troubled him, kept him from sleep for some hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But before he could give the question fuller thought, new and undreamed of
      conditions arose that changed the whole aspect of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a couple of days afterwards. He sat in a solicitor&rsquo;s office staring
      at a little whiskered gentleman, whose even voice seemed to come from some
      other world. He had called in response to a letter, bringing with him the
      few documents he possessed&mdash;his dead mother&rsquo;s marriage certificate,
      his own birth certificate, and his old indentures of apprenticeship. He
      had thought it a question of some trifling legacy on the part of the dead
      uncle whom he had never known, who had disowned his mother because she had
      brought disgrace on the family by marrying Sam Goddard the builder. He had
      conjectured that the hard old heart that had stonily refused succour to
      widowed sister had melted before his death, and had sought to make some
      little posthumous reparation to his sister&rsquo;s son. Save that Robert Haig
      was a well-to-do hosier in Birmingham, Goddard knew nothing at all about
      him. But when the little whiskered man announced that this unknown uncle
      had died, wifeless, childless, and intestate, that he, Goddard, was the
      next-of-kin, and inherited, not only the business as it stood, but a
      considerable sum of invested money, that brought in between four and five
      hundred a year, he stared, open-mouthed, in blank amazement, and it was
      some time before he could recover his bewildered faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no one who has a better right to all this money than I?&rdquo; he
      asked, after a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a soul. Since the death of his wife and daughter the late Mr. Haig
      had neither kith nor kin besides yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you find my whereabouts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him as if he were living for the moment the irresponsible
      life of comic opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simplest thing in the world,&rdquo; replied the lawyer. &ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s letters
      were found docketed amongst Mr. Haig&rsquo;s papers. The last one, appealing to
      him for help on the occasion of your father&rsquo;s death, contained the address
      of the firm of cabinetmakers to whom you were indentured. They gave us
      your present address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goddard rose from his chair, and made one or two turns about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to realise it all at once,&rdquo; he said, stopping before the
      solicitor. &ldquo;But I think I have grasped it now. What would you advise me to
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go as soon as possible to Birmingham and see our
      principals, Messrs. Taylor &amp; Blythe. We are only acting for them, you
      know. They will be able to go into fuller details with you, particularly
      in the matter of the hosiery business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to sell that,&rdquo; said Goddard quickly. &ldquo;It would be a white
      elephant to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should strongly dissuade you from parting with it,&rdquo; said the lawyer.
      &ldquo;It appears to be a going concern. You should keep it on. Work it up. You
      would soon get into the way of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And turn hosier? Oh no! I&rsquo;m proud of my handicraft, and I would go on
      with it if there were any necessity. But to wear a long frock-coat, and
      sell collars and neckties behind a counter&mdash;I am afraid I wasn&rsquo;t made
      for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed at the vision of himself. The lawyer smiled too. The dark,
      heavily-cut face, with its great forehead and bright clever eyes, giving
      its promise of strength and intellect, seemed fitted for more strenuous
      work than shrewd buying and polite selling of hosiery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll think it over,&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Goddard. &ldquo;It
      strikes me I have a deal of thinking to do the next few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got into a District train to return to the workshop, from which he had
      obtained a couple of hours&rsquo; leave of absence. The journey passed in a
      dream. The fortune that had befallen him seemed almost beyond his powers
      of realisation. The prospective changes in his life presented themselves
      before him in quick succession&mdash;the suggestion of one leading to the
      shock of another. His trade would be abandoned, unless he chose to
      continue it as a hobby. He need never do an hour&rsquo;s work again as long as
      he lived. He could live in a comfortable house of his own, surround
      himself with books&mdash;an endless vista of shelf upon shelf quivered
      before his eyes. The possession of such an income demanded changes in
      habits, food, raiment. It gave infinite leisure. And then a thought that
      had gradually been piercing through the cloud of his bewilderment broke
      out like a sun over his mind, causing his heart to leap in a thrilling
      delight, as a great life-work was revealed to him. He no longer need stand
      at the brink of the great struggle, lending a helping hand in all too few
      hours of leisure. He could plunge into the very midst, fight for the cause
      of the people with all his brain and heart and energies. His face flushed,
      and his breath came quickly. It was a chilly day, and a man seated
      opposite to him in the third-class carriage was surprised to see him wipe
      the perspiration from his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there was Lizzie. He would tell her that evening. He pictured to
      himself the ecstatic wonder on her pretty face. But the greater passion
      held him, and Lizzie&rsquo;s face floated vaguely behind the flashing dreams of
      work and struggle and victories.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the workshop he sought his employer, but the latter was absent. Goddard
      took off his coat, put on his apron, rolled up his sleeves, and turned to
      the fitting of the writing-table on which he had been engaged that
      morning. The feeling that he was doing this familiar thing for the last
      time made it appear strangely unreal. His tool-bag seemed no longer to
      belong to him. He had given it, in his mind, to the young apprentice who
      was working at his side. He joined in the desultory chat and jesting of
      his companions with the ready good humour that had always made him popular
      among them; but his brain throbbed with the effort of self-control. He
      worked steadily, with the deft, sure touch of the skilled craftsman. The
      pigeon-hole slides ran into the grooves without a hairbreadth deviation,
      the little secret panel ran in and out without the hitch that a grain of
      dust could have made. It was gratifying to him to be able to put the
      finishing touches to a piece of work he had undertaken. When he had done,
      he passed his hand caressingly over the polished curves of the sliding
      cover. He was proud of his craft. It was a beautiful thing that had shaped
      itself under his touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If all the work I do in the future,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;is as perfect of its
      kind as this, I need fear no rivals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was over. He had had a pleasant interview with his employer, had
      received the hearty congratulations of his mates, who, after the manner
      understanded of the British workman, drank to his health and prosperity at
      a neighbouring tavern. He had bidden farewell to the trade in which he had
      found so much honest happiness. Again the sense of unreality came over
      him. The change had come so suddenly, so unexpectedly. That morning he had
      risen a poor artisan; he would lie down that night the owner of fabulous
      wealth, which he was going to Birmingham the next day to claim. In spite
      of the strong will that strove to repress extravagant fancies, and to put
      matters in a common-sense, practical light, his imagination slipped
      elusively from his control, and ran riot amid the courts and halls of airy
      palaces.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;THE END OF AN ACT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r., or, as he
      loved to be designated, Captain Jenkyns, had once followed the sea. But
      that was a long time ago. The serious part of his life had been spent on a
      Thames steamer. The outer man was nautical, and the carnal inner, as an
      inveterate craving for fiery drink clearly proved; but many years of fresh
      water seemed to have washed the true sailor&rsquo;s kindly salt out of his
      nature. He was a thick-set, grizzled old man, with bibulous superannuation
      written on every wrinkle that mounted to his little red-rimmed eyes, and
      in every filament of the network of tiny red veins on his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting in the leathern arm-chair, with his back to the parlour
      window, drinking his tea out of a saucer. Goddard and Lizzie sat
      decorously at the tea-table. It was a ceremonious occasion, as the use of
      the parlour, the potted ham and seed-cake on the table, Captain Jenkyns&rsquo;s
      brass-buttoned coat, and the little blue ribbon round Lizzie&rsquo;s neck, with
      the bow tied kittenishly under her ear, all combined to testify.
      Previously Goddard used to join the domestic circle in the kitchen, but
      then he had never been to Birmingham nor opened a banking account at the
      City Bank. That made all the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, conversation had not been animated. Goddard had conducted it
      practically alone, sketching his visit to Birmingham, which had terminated
      to his complete satisfaction. An offer for the shop and good-will was
      already under consideration. The solicitors had advanced him a good round
      sum for present needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To keep a shop warn&rsquo;t good enough for yer, I suppose,&rdquo; Captain Jenkyns
      had remarked in his agreeable way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Goddard had answered coldly&mdash;he did not love the captain. &ldquo;It
      wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he had proceeded with his story. But the talk languished. Lizzie,
      never expansive in her father&rsquo;s presence, was less so to-day than usual.
      Goddard&rsquo;s sudden accession to wealth&mdash;riches beyond the dreams of
      Lizzie&rsquo;s avarice&mdash;somewhat awed her, after the first excitement had
      passed. His cleverness, his personality, all in fact that differentiated
      him from Joe Forster the tobacconist and his class, had always put him a
      little beyond her reach; but now that he was a rich man as well, she felt
      frightened and abashed. She offered him bread and butter timidly, and
      flushed scarlet when she awkwardly flooded his tea-cup. Then crumbs of
      cake went the wrong way, and she retired to the window to hide her
      discomfiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you&rsquo;re a hindependent gentleman,&rdquo; said the old man after a pause,
      setting down his saucer. &ldquo;I suppose you won&rsquo;t want to be thinking of
      marrying my gell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goddard sprang to his feet. He had his own reasons for feeling stung to
      the quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right to say that,&rdquo; he cried hotly. &ldquo;What do you take me
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ex-captain made the motion of &ldquo;Ease her!&rdquo; with his hand, and chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I don&rsquo;t know human natur&rsquo;, when I&rsquo;ve seed boat-loads of it
      every day for sixty years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t know my nature,&rdquo; said Daniel. &ldquo;Lizzie, come here. We&rsquo;ll
      soon settle that matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie turned from the window and advanced towards him, flushing
      uncomfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damme! I don&rsquo;t want you to marry her. I don&rsquo;t care a tinker&rsquo;s damn,&rdquo; said
      the old man with unreasonable heat, as Goddard met Lizzie and took her by
      the hand. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going down on my bended knees to ask you to marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father! don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Lizzie on the brink of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Goddard. &ldquo;<i>I</i> want to marry you, and I&rsquo;m going to
      marry you. I&rsquo;ll have the banns put up next Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have a special licence at once?&rdquo; growled the Captain
      sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I know my own business best,&rdquo; said Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m blarsted if you&rsquo;ll have her at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a scene, father,&rdquo; Lizzie entreated. She tried to slip away,
      but Goddard&rsquo;s arm tightened and restrained her. He looked with disgust on
      the ignoble old face that blinked in cantankerous dignity. Save on the
      ground of pure ill-temper he could not understand his outburst. Lizzie had
      often told him of the awful rows she had had with her father about nothing
      at all. But Goddard was not the man to be bullied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lizzie is over twenty-one, and I&rsquo;m going to marry her whether you are
      blasted or not, Captain Jenkyns. You can take that from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re a &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;er fool than I took you for,&rdquo; replied
      the Captain, giving in beneath the young fellow&rsquo;s strong gaze. &ldquo;Marry in
      haste; repent at leisure. You want to make a lady of her. She ain&rsquo;t going
      to be no lady. It&rsquo;s only going to set her off her &rsquo;ead. Think she&rsquo;s
      going to recognise her poor old father when she lives in a fine &rsquo;ouse
      and dressed in silks and satins? Not a bit of it. I know human natur&rsquo;, I
      tell yer. I brought her up to be an honest working man&rsquo;s wife. That&rsquo;s what
      she&rsquo;s fit for. So that she could give me a bit of dinner on Sundays. Now
      you&rsquo;re a going to take her away from her natural surroundings, what she
      was born in, and make her neither flesh, nor fowl, nor good red &rsquo;erring.
      Think I don&rsquo;t know? And you, with your &rsquo;igh-falutin&rsquo; idea about
      being too good to keep a shop, you ought to marry a duchess instead of a
      poor old sailor&rsquo;s gell: that&rsquo;s what you ought to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He produced a flat bottle of rum from his side pocket, filled his
      half-emptied tea-cup with spirits, and drank the compound to console his
      poor old sailor&rsquo;s paternal heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard, seeing that the storm was over, smiled at the mixture of
      shrewdness and selfishness in the old man&rsquo;s speech. Certain home-truths
      made him wince a little; but the prospect of Captain Jenkyns not finding a
      seat at his Sunday dinner-table did not present itself to him as in any
      way pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said good-humouredly, &ldquo;I am not going to marry a duchess, but a
      girl as sweet as one. Isn&rsquo;t that true, Liz? And so there&rsquo;s an end to the
      matter. I suppose I can count on you to give her away, Captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll give her away. Jolly good riddance,&rdquo; growled the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short while afterwards he rose, filled his clay pipe with cavendish,
      which he ground fine between his hands, and excusing himself on the score
      of business, left the two young people to themselves. His destination,
      however, was a far-off river-side public, where he spent the rest of the
      evening with his cronies, and informed them, in speech that grew gradually
      more marked by thickness and profanity, of the approaching splendour of
      his daughter&rsquo;s fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, Lizzie,&rdquo; said Goddard, as she began to clear away the
      tea-things in silence. &ldquo;We neither of us mind what he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He makes me so ashamed,&rdquo; said Lizzie. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know where to look. He&rsquo;s
      been at it ever since you&rsquo;ve been away, saying as how you would want to
      back out; and he made me quite miserable, he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baby-blue eyes filled with tears. Goddard consoled her as best he
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; he said, patting her shoulder with his great
      hand. &ldquo;The banns will be put up next Sunday, as I said; and three weeks
      won&rsquo;t be long, you know; and then it will all be over, and we&rsquo;ll start
      fair. Leave those things alone for the present, and let us talk about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they sat, side by side, over the fire, and spoke of the near future.
      They would live in lodgings until they could find a house to suit them.
      They discussed the size of the house, its position, the furniture, the
      question of servants. They came nearer the present, and Goddard counted
      out into her hand six crisp bank-notes wherewith to buy her trousseau.
      Lizzie&rsquo;s mind swam in ecstatic wonderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this&mdash;for me?&rdquo; she whispered, awestricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and as much more if you like. I am going to get a new rig out, so
      why shouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dan,&rdquo; she broke out suddenly, throwing her arms round his neck, &ldquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t quite know whether I loved you before&mdash;but I do now&mdash;Dan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There followed an interlude, during which the future was left in abeyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was wondering <i>how</i> I was going to get a wedding-dress. Emmie
      and I have talked for hours over it. Won&rsquo;t I get a beauty now! White satin
      with a long, long train. I saw one yesterday in a fashion-plate&mdash;oh!
      just lovely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you won&rsquo;t feel married otherwise,&rdquo; he said, with a quiet smile.
      And then, seeing a quick shadow of dismay on her face, he laughed and
      kissed her. &ldquo;You shall drive to the church in a coach and four, with the
      horses&rsquo; manes and tails all tied up with orange-blossoms, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw he was jesting kindly, and joined in the laugh&mdash;but
      perfunctorily. The wedding-dress was the ecstatic, enrapturing part of the
      ceremony. To jest upon it savoured of profanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while Lizzie returned to the tea-things, and, aided by Daniel,
      washed them up in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only fancy! I am going to have servants to do this for me ever
      afterwards,&rdquo; she said brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The possession of the trousseau money had strongly influenced the girl&rsquo;s
      facile temperament. The changed fortune ceased to be shadowy and
      disquieting. It had assumed already a comforting, concrete form. The
      overwhelming realisation of the potential finery that lay in those crisp
      notes had crushed any feelings of delicacy in accepting the gift. The
      first wondering delight and childlike impulse of gratitude to Goddard was
      succeeded by a new sense of personal importance. Her garments would be
      dazzling&mdash;the thought of them raised her to a height whence she could
      almost look down upon Daniel. She no longer felt shy or constrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the parlour, a prim little room, with a pervading
      impression of horse-hair, crocheted antimacassars, woolly mats and
      wax-fruit, and again envisaged the future. Lizzie sat in her father&rsquo;s
      arm-chair, her hands deliciously idle in her lap, her mind all
      transcendental millinery. Goddard rested his elbow on the table, pushed
      back his hair from his forehead, and looked at her gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not all going to be beer and skittles, you know, Liz,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Although I have chucked the working-man, I am going in for precious hard
      work all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, whatever for, when you haven&rsquo;t your living to get?&rdquo; she asked in
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the apocryphal British workman, Lizzie hated work, and hated those
      that liked it. She saw no point in unnecessary labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Goddard, his face lighting up with the impulse of reply. &ldquo;Not
      my own living to get, thank God, but I have to help others to get theirs.
      I may not be able to do much. But when a lot of men work together, every
      little effort of each tells. And I mean, too, to come to the front, Liz,
      for the nearer the front a man is, the bigger the things he can do. And
      the front means a big position in Parliament, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to
      try and get before I die. If I don&rsquo;t, it won&rsquo;t be for want of fighting.
      But it will be a long time coming, and will take me all I know. That&rsquo;s why
      I didn&rsquo;t take over the shop in Birmingham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s why?&rdquo; said Lizzie, trying to look sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. You see it wasn&rsquo;t because I suddenly became too big for my
      boots&mdash;but I wanted all my time to myself for this other work. I have
      made a fair start. I know something about the inner workings of things
      already, and I can get men to listen to me when I speak. So I am going to
      work like a nigger, Liz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat silent and plucked at her dress. It was very wonderful and clever
      of Daniel to talk about becoming a Member of Parliament, but she could not
      in the least see why it was necessary for him to work like a nigger. In
      her heart she regretted the hosier&rsquo;s shop, but she was afraid to tell him
      so. She looked up at him and smiled, with the outside of her features as
      it were, after the manner of dutiful yet uninterested woman. Goddard,
      encouraged, continued to unfold his schemes. He was in intense earnest,
      and spoke to her, as he had never spoken before, of the burning questions
      of the day&mdash;the unequal struggle between labour and capital, the
      iniquity of the living wage, the stupendous problem of the unemployed, the
      great reforms on whose behalf he felt summoned forth to fight. And as the
      passion grew upon him, his voice vibrated and his eyes glowed, and his
      words waxed eloquent. He broke the bonds of his usual speech with her,
      partly through a need of expansion, partly through a half-conscious desire
      to awaken a little of the girl&rsquo;s sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had done, and a little pause had followed, she looked up from the
      puckering of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all lovely, Dan,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but what am <i>I</i> to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question brought his thoughts down from the empyræan like a gash in a
      balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there will be the house to look after,&rdquo; he said, in an altered
      tone; &ldquo;and then&mdash;well&mdash;there will be babies&mdash;and lots of
      things,&rdquo; he concluded lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t like babies,&rdquo; said Lizzie, with frank inconsequence. &ldquo;They
      always want such a lot of fussing after, and they&rsquo;re always squalling. I&rsquo;m
      sure I shall want to smack them. Nasty little things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her rather perplexedly. It was a delicate subject. She caught
      his glance and coloured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t go saying such things,&rdquo; she murmured, giggling in
      embarrassment&mdash;&ldquo;and we not married yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then something seemed to catch him by the heart, a queer chilly grip, and
      tug it downwards. He blamed himself for having suggested the idea,
      although he had done so without shadowing thoughts. The innuendo jarred
      upon him&mdash;he could not tell why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence for some time. Goddard idly turned over the leaves of
      a rickety album filled with faded photographs of stiff, staring people in
      the costume of the sixties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie lay back in her chair, and devised the white satin wedding-dress.
      At last she called to him softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, saw her reclining there, smiling at him. Her cheeks were so
      pink, her fair hair so bewilderingly soft and fluffy, her parted lips so
      fresh and inviting, her young figure so cleanly cut, in spite of the
      ill-fitting dress and cheap corsets beneath, her white throat set off by
      the coquettish blue ribbon so alluring, that the heart of the young man,
      who knew little of the ways and fascinations of women, threw off the cold
      grip in a great quick throb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t given me a kiss all the time, Dan,&rdquo; she said without
      stirring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he rose and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the next day he called on the vicar of the parish, and settled the
      question of the banns. It was over. He felt lighter. There is nothing that
      is more irksome to a strong-willed man than indecision, and Goddard had
      passed through a period of grave misgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way down the path to the vicarage gate, however, he met Mr.
      Aloysius Gleam just entering it. The Member let fall his gold-rimmed
      eye-glass in some surprise, as he greeted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, more miracles? You in the house of Rimmon?&rdquo; he exclaimed, for
      Goddard had been a thorn in the vicar&rsquo;s flesh for some time past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get married,&rdquo; replied Goddard, by way of explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Member drooped his shoulders and lowered the point of his stick in a
      helpless attitude, and looked at him with an air of dismay. &ldquo;What <i>are</i>
      you doing it for? Just when you ought to be going round the country like a
      firebrand. Now you&rsquo;ll be a damp faggot. I know. Go back and tell the vicar
      you didn&rsquo;t mean it. It was an elaborate &lsquo;draw&rsquo; on your part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daniel stuck his hands in his pockets and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel inclined to answer you like Touchstone,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce you do,&rdquo; said Gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick glance passed between them, and a shade of annoyance came over
      Goddard&rsquo;s dark face. The analogy perhaps was closer than he intended. The
      other might retort with the gibes of Jacques.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t my business,&rdquo; added Gleam in a deprecating tone. &ldquo;But
      it might have been better for you to have waited&mdash;considering the
      change in your fortune, and your scheme of life generally. Well, I suppose
      folks will marry. It is even within the bounds of possibility I may do it
      myself one of these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put up his eye-glass and passed his fingers over his tight fair
      moustache, as if to prepare himself for the ordeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t interfere with any of our plans, I can assure you,&rdquo; said
      Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Don&rsquo;t let it, for goodness&rsquo; sake. But marriage is a
      function of two independent variables, as they say in the differential
      calculus&mdash;and a deuced tough function too. Anyhow, if you&rsquo;re bent
      upon it, I wish you luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands and parted. Goddard turned away slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Member&rsquo;s words sounded again the note of warning, the same note that
      had rung in those of the old man on the previous day, the same that had
      rung in his own ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I should have been a knave to have done differently,&rdquo; he thought to
      himself. &ldquo;There was only one alternative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had deliberately chosen the part of the fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am damned glad,&rdquo; he said aloud, swinging his stick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk
      straight, now and ever afterwards, whatever happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three weeks afterwards they were married, and Lizzie&rsquo;s wedding-dress, to
      her trembling joy, was fully described in the <i>Sunington Weekly
      Chronicle</i>.

      CHAPTER IV&mdash;LADY PHAYRE AND THE COMING MAN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;I</span> WISH something
      new would happen,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the session just begun,&rdquo; replied Mr. Aloysius Gleam, drawing his
      arm-chair an inch nearer the fire. &ldquo;We can promise you many New Year
      novelties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call you them novelties?&rdquo; asked Lady Phayre. &ldquo;They will be as old as&mdash;as
      the antepenultimate barrel-organ tune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to go too fast. Great political reforms move slowly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is true&mdash;deadeningly true. I think I read it once in a
      newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gleam laughed, and spread out his hands before the blaze. He was familiar
      with her mood&mdash;a mild spiritual unrest, induced by supreme bodily
      comfort and intellectual disturbance. He had the faculty of the aesthetic
      as well as ultrademocratic tendencies, and he appreciated the harmony
      between her mood and the dim afternoon hour with its gathering shadows in
      comers of the room. Her comfortable attitude, with one hand hanging over
      the arm of the chair; her costume, a dark fur-edged tea-gown; her
      expression of wistful meditation&mdash;all betokened a relaxation of fibre
      trying to pamper itself into depression. So the Member laughed, and a
      smile played round his clean-shaven lips in the silence that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The politician within the esoteric revolutionary ring, who did not know
      Lady Phayre, was like a Positivist ignorant of Auguste Comte. The analogy
      halts, however. Lady Phayre was far from being an evangelist; she was not
      even an apostle. She had been left with the key of a pleasant situation,
      and, like a wise woman, she used it. Her enemies called her insincere. If
      the late Sir Ephraim, they said, had sat as a Conservative, and had formed
      the cartilage as it were of a brilliant wing of that party, Lady Phayre&rsquo;s
      flat would have become an audaciously unauthorised Primrose Habitation.
      But political opponents will say anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly she took no combative part in political warfare. Her functions
      were rather those of an etherealised <i>vivandière</i> to the band. The
      members came exhausted into her drawing-room, where she revived them with
      pannikins of sympathy, and spread the delicate ointment of flattery over
      their bruises. Not but what she exposed herself in times of need to the
      dangers and fatigues of the campaign. She had risked typhoid in slums, and
      congestion of the lungs in draughty halls. She also kept bravely up with
      the march, picking her dainty way through prodigious quantities of
      speeches, pamphlets, and articles, both in type and manuscript. Now and
      then she stumbled sorely. Bimetallism was a morass, and trade statistics
      stone fences. On these occasions she would cry out for a helping hand,
      preferably that of Aloysius Gleam; after which she would survey herself
      with rueful introspection, and put to herself the question addressed to
      the immortal Scapin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mood of to-day followed one of these periodic rescuings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hendrick&rsquo;s amendment is coming on this evening,&rdquo; said Aloysius Gleam at
      last. &ldquo;The audacity of it is novel enough. Come down. It will amuse you.
      Burnet has a lady&rsquo;s ticket going a-begging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had enough of Hendrick for some time,&rdquo; replied Lady Phayre. &ldquo;He
      took me down to dinner last night at the M&rsquo;Kays&rsquo;, and could talk of
      nothing else. I wish you could put some sense into him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could. But a Collectivist who has broken loose is running
      headlong to destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was what I told him. Push Collectivism to its logical conclusion,
      and we get Mr. Bellamy&rsquo;s intolerable paradise. He got purple in the face,
      said he was nothing if not logical, insisted on the establishment of
      comparative values for different kinds of labour and products, and called
      me a reactionary because I asked him how the State was going to determine
      the number of mutton chops that would go to a sonnet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that phrase your own, Lady Phayre?&rdquo; asked Gleam, pricking up his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, with a little touch of audacity. &ldquo;I snapped it up as an
      unconsidered trifle out of a review article.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goddard&rsquo;s, I think, on Extremism as applied to Practical Politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an encyclopaedia,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre, laughing. &ldquo;You know
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you like the article?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immensely. I detached it from the review, and restitched it with blue
      ribbon to use as a text-book. Without it I might have been led to
      destruction by Hendrick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear Lady Phayre&mdash;I shall not tell it in Gath; but when are
      you going to have views of your own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Views? Of course I have views,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre, comfortably reversing
      the crossing of her feet, &ldquo;just like everybody else, only theirs are fixed
      and mine are&mdash;dissolving. It gives greater variety to life. But I
      think the Goddard view will be lasting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell him. He will be flattered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty intimately. I may say that I trained him&mdash;in the sporting,
      not the pedagogic sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never told me. Have you many more lights under your bushel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dazzling illumination of unsuspected virtues. But I didn&rsquo;t do very much
      for Goddard except put him in the way of things; and he would have come to
      the front right enough without me. He is the coming man of the younger
      school of Progressists. The anomaly of his generation&mdash;a hot reformer
      with luminous common-sense&mdash;a popular demagogue with an idea of
      proportion&mdash;an original thinker&mdash;a powerful, eloquent speaker.
      Look at the work he has done on the Council, the Progressive League&mdash;ramifications
      spreading all over the country with organised courses of lectures on
      civism, social economics, and what not. Decidedly the coming man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does one good to see you enthusiastic,&rdquo; cried Lady Phayre with a
      laugh. &ldquo;Your criticisms are generally more bracing than genial. But why
      don&rsquo;t I know Goddard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He surely has not sprung suddenly into your horizon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. The newspapers&mdash;general talk&mdash;I know all about
      him that way. I meant, why don&rsquo;t I know him personally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a touch of reprimand in the &ldquo;why.&rdquo; Gleam was Lord Chamberlain in
      Ordinary to her ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was waiting until he got into the House at the next general election.
      You see, until seven years ago, when he came into some money that rendered
      him independent, he was a carpenter or something&mdash;no, cabinetmaker&mdash;and
      so, to be frank, I never thought of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you call yourself a Radical! Well, what is the matter with him? Does
      he wear corduroys tied up at the knees, and carry a red
      pocket-handkerchief in his hat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear no!&rdquo; exclaimed Gleam hastily. &ldquo;He is presentable. I told you of a
      little training&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, lose no time in bringing him,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre. &ldquo;He surely
      must have heard of <i>me</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was proud of her position: somewhat jealous of it too. That a
      generation of Progressists should arise which knew not Lady Phayre was a
      dreadful contingency. She had a prescriptive right to the homage of the
      coming man of the wing. Besides, an ex-cabinetmaker whose views on social
      polity she had thought worth while to tie up with blue ribbon was a
      novelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aloysius Gleam took his leave. At the door he was summoned to pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t walk up and down the room and shake his finger at me, will he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Fenton?&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;No, you can reassure your nerves. By the way,&rdquo;
       he cried suddenly, &ldquo;there is a large meeting at Stepney next week,
      Thursday, at which Goddard is going to speak, and I have promised to say
      something. Would you care to come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre. &ldquo;Then I can see for myself
      whether he is like Fenton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can guarantee that,&rdquo; said Gleam, with a final word of adieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank back in her chair relieved. Fenton was an aggressive person, fond
      of hurling at her his theory of State education of babies as the sovereign
      panacea for the Weltschmerz. She was a practical woman; and philosophical
      ideas, unless gracefully conveyed, rather bored her. She could see no
      sense in their absolute use. A limitless volume of abstraction did not
      interest her so much as a cubic inch of solid fact. That was why she liked
      Aloysius Gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      She meditated a little longer before the fire, then she switched on the
      electric light, rang for the curtains to be drawn, and re-read Daniel
      Goddard&rsquo;s article until it was time to dress for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a new experience for Lady Phayre. She was familiar with
      platforms, and the sight of the pale, moving mass of human faces in front.
      She had listened to the speeches of many demagogues to the proletariat,
      and had found them singularly lacking in originality. Accordingly, it was
      with the air of an old campaigner that she settled herself down by the
      side of Aloysius Gleam, and surveyed the decorous occupants of the
      platform, and the noisy but enthusiastic audience of working men and women
      in the body of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proceedings had already commenced when they entered. The chairman was
      concluding his introductory speech. The courteous applause that followed
      his remarks suddenly grew into the thunder that comes from the heart.
      Goddard was standing before the table, his massive dark face lit with
      pleasure at his welcome. He began to speak. His voice, rich and sonorous,
      rang out through the last dying cheers, and compelled willing attention.
      After a few moments he held the audience in his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Phayre bent forward and looked with interested curiosity at the
      speaker, whom she saw mostly in profile, at intervals full-face, when he
      flashed round to the side benches. Her quick perception appreciated the
      mastery he had obtained over his hearers, their instant responsiveness to
      his touch. She herself was gradually drawn under the spell, felt herself
      but a chord of the instrument that responded to every shade of invective,
      irony, and promise. She was not unconscious of a certain unfamiliar
      sensuousness in this surrender of her individuality. Perhaps feminine
      instincts that had long lain dormant were awakened. The sense of power in
      the man set working deep-hidden springs of sensation. A strain of the
      barbaric lingers even in so super-refined a product as Lady Phayre. When
      Goddard had finished speaking, she leaned back in her chair with a kind of
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the genuine article, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Gleam, turning to her
      smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, rested her glance thoughtfully upon him for a moment. He
      seemed so small, precise, uninspiring compared with the huge-limbed man
      with the leonine face and rolling voice who had just been swaying her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a power among these people,&rdquo; she said below her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deserve some credit, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he remarked. He was proud of Goddard,
      honestly delighted at the impression his pupil had made upon Lady Phayre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The succeeding speeches, modest and formal, after Goddard&rsquo;s magnetic
      harangue, were quickly over. After three cheers for Dan Goddard, the
      audience broke up. The occupants of the platform formed into little
      groups. Gleam drew Goddard from the largest of these.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to present you to Lady Phayre, the Lady Superior of the League.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And before the other could reply, he had taken him prisoner by the lapel
      of his coat, and brought him, in his brisk way, to where Lady Phayre was
      standing, and had gone through the formality of presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had a great success to-night, Mr. Goddard,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easy to speak to an enthusiastic audience,&rdquo; said Goddard. &ldquo;You see
      we mean business,&rdquo; he added, addressing Gleam. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done our share in
      agitation. It is for you people in the House now to carry the bill
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll undertake to see that they don&rsquo;t halt by the way,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre
      with bewitching authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you were in the House, Goddard,&rdquo; said Gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me a seat and I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; he replied with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have the Hough division offered you according to general whisper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not under a miracle,&rdquo; said Goddard. &ldquo;The moderate element in the
      constituency is too strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard they were going to run an Independent Labour candidate,&rdquo;
       interposed Lady Phayre. &ldquo;I know the neighbourhood pretty well. Some
      friends I often stay with live near Ecclesby, and I hear the local gossip
      through them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would withdraw the Labour man and support Goddard, if he stood,&rdquo;
       explained Gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Goddard laughed deprecatingly and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all in the clouds. Repson has not resigned the seat yet. It is only
      a rumour that he intends doing so, and haste in the matter would be
      indecent. Anyhow,&rdquo; he added, after a pause, to Lady Phayre, &ldquo;if you would
      tell Mr. Gleam any news you may get, you would be doing me a service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not come and get it first hand?&rdquo; asked Lady Phayre sweetly. &ldquo;I should
      be most pleased to see you if you would call&mdash;13 Queen&rsquo;s Court
      Mansions&mdash;Tuesdays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; said Goddard, bowing. &ldquo;I had better give you a card,&rdquo;
       she said, taking one from an elaborate little memoranda-book; &ldquo;then you
      won&rsquo;t forget the address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They remained a while in desultory talk. Then Lady Phayre departed under
      Gleam&rsquo;s escort, and Goddard returned to the group that had been waiting
      for him. An eager discussion, prolonged until the party broke up in the
      street, swept away from Goddard&rsquo;s mind every lingering impression of his
      first interview with Lady Phayre.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V&mdash;LIZZIE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he National
      Progressive League, under whose auspices the meeting at Stepney had been
      held, had originated in the minds of certain members of the extreme
      Parliamentary left, the most active of whom were the late Sir Ephraim
      Phayre, the chief, and Mr. Aloysius Gleam, his henchman. Its primary
      object was to form a strong wing of the Liberal party, in which
      extremists, opportunists, and the waverers on the edge of the Independent
      Labour Party might rally together around practical Collectivist
      principles. It sought to embrace academic Radicalism and the interests of
      the Labour Party in a broader scheme of imperial policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Goddard threw himself into the work of the League it had all the
      promise and vitality of youth. Centres were being rapidly established
      throughout the kingdom. Systems of lectures on social and political
      subjects were being organised. Meetings, conferences, and demonstrations
      were arranged under its auspices. Pamphlets were published from its
      headquarters in London, as well as a vigorously written journal. Besides
      thus working on its own account, the League was gradually gathering
      influence enough to constitute itself a great agency. It sent speakers to
      political gatherings, and canvassers to Parliamentary and municipal
      elections. It gained the confidence of the great trades unions and
      operatives&rsquo; associations, and provided helpers in labour conflicts. It was
      in touch at all points with political life&mdash;a vast undertaking,
      offering an unlimited field for the energies of its supporters. Its
      Statistical Bureau alone was capable of almost infinite extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a thrilling sense of pride that Goddard found himself in the
      full stream of the new movement. Every day brought him an added sense of
      power and responsibility. To qualify himself for the tasks that devolved
      upon him, he read deeply and widely, setting himself resolutely to fill in
      the gaps of his self-education. He studied French, German, Latin,
      beginning the latter with <i>mensa</i>, like a child, and strove to train
      his taste and judgment by extending his acquaintance with pure literature.
      His vigorous intellect assimilated rapidly, both from books and men, and
      gradually, as the months passed into years, his views became clearer, his
      judgments more penetrating, and his grasp more sure and far-reaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      The League work, and afterwards his election to a political club, brought
      him into frequent contact with Aloysius Gleam. The latter was anxious to
      keep in touch with Goddard, not only because he foresaw in him a valuable
      man for the party, but also because he took a keen personal interest in
      the young man&rsquo;s career. He had all a shrewd, generous little man&rsquo;s vanity
      in extending to a big man the patronage he felt would soon not be needed.
      To his friends he prophesied great things of Goddard. He introduced him to
      the chief shortly before Sir Ephraim&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is courageous of you to tackle that powerful-faced young giant,&rdquo; said
      Sir Ephraim, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Gleam, &ldquo;I feel like a hen hatching an ostrich egg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when the young ostrich stalked out of the shell, and in the course of
      time took up its position in the world as a superior bird, Aloysius Gleam
      looked on with undisguised satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, in the early days of Goddard&rsquo;s affluence, Gleam interrupted a warm
      discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take elocution lessons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought of it,&rdquo; Goddard replied. &ldquo;I have no desire to become an
      elegant orator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be useful to you in your private speech,&rdquo; said Gleam, looking at
      him in his shrewd way. Goddard frowned perplexedly. Then he understood and
      coloured slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to pretend to be better than I am,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If my speech
      shows I belong to the people, so much the better. No one will think the
      worse of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gleam laid his hand kindly on the young democrat&rsquo;s arm&mdash;they were
      walking up and down the lobby of the House&mdash;and broke out into an
      impetuous harangue. The young man&rsquo;s argument was easily demolished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was that in this, as in many other things, he took Gleam&rsquo;s
      advice. He was no fool for angry pride to furnish him with cap and bells.
      He saw, when he came to consider the matter dispassionately, that though
      London Doric might be sweet in the ears of the proletariat, it grated on
      the finer susceptibilities of the House of Commons. Whereupon he set to
      work upon elocution with the tireless energy of a Demosthenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in seven years he had gained for himself an ever-growing reputation.
      The great reviews had opened their pages to him. The League intrusted him
      with responsible work. He was on the London County Council, and a seat in
      Parliament awaited him at no distant future.
    </p>
    <p>
      To please his wife, Daniel had not settled down in Sunington. He had
      bidden farewell reluctantly, for it meant the sundering of many ties, and
      the surrendering of many interests. But Lizzie had been insistent. Visions
      of domestic harmony, disturbed by incursions of Captain Jenkyns in an
      advanced state of profanity, had prompted earnest beseeching. Perhaps she
      was wise; for soon after her marriage the old reprobate, to the exceeding
      great scandal of the neighbourhood, took to himself a mistress-housekeeper
      in the shape of a flaunting, red-faced female of pugnacious instincts, who
      had retained possession of the house after his death. Their goings on,
      Emily and Sophie declared, had been something awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie had been well out of it. Daniel would never have been able to hold
      up his head for the disgrace; whereat Daniel had smiled somewhat
      sardonically. His skin was a little too tough, he said, for vicarious
      reprobation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lizzie had other and more private reasons for wishing to migrate. In
      the first flush of her dignity she had shrunk from the streets with which
      she had been too grossly familiar during her early girlhood. She had
      larked with the butcher&rsquo;s boy, played kiss in the ring with the
      greengrocer&rsquo;s assistant, and kept very serious company with Joe Forster
      the tobacconist. Such daily reminiscences are apt to prove embarrassing.
      The translated Lizzie had felt out of her element in Sunington. So, to
      please her, Daniel had come into London and taken a house in Notting Hill,
      where they had remained during the seven years of their married life.

      It was late when Goddard stood before the familiar door, on his return
      from the Stepney meeting. An expression of impatience escaped his lips as
      he noticed a light in the basement; otherwise, with the exception of the
      faintly illuminated fanlight, the house was in darkness. He let himself in
      with his latch-key, and walking the length of the dim passage, descended
      the kitchen stairs, groping his way. He opened the kitchen door softly,
      and found the housemaid asleep, with her head on the deal table. Awakened
      by his presence, the girl started in some confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you gone to bed, Jane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone was less one of reprimand than that of a man repeating a
      disagreeable formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistress was very poorly to-night, sir, and I thought I had better sit up
      till you came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, looked at her sombrely from beneath his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see her to bed comfortably?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t Miss Jenkyns been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Miss Sophie came for an hour this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Goddard, turning on his heel. &ldquo;Go to bed now, there&rsquo;s a
      good girl. You must be tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went heavily up the stairs again, turned off the gas in the hall, and
      continued his ascent. On the first floor he paused, leaned his ear against
      the bedroom door, and listened. Satisfied with a sound of heavy breathing
      within, he mounted the next flight and lit the gas in his own study,
      stirred a blackening fire, and after warming his hands for a few seconds,
      sat down at his writing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a plainly furnished room, lined with books in sober bindings,
      sloping and falling, with great gaps, untidily, in the shelves. A great
      table, covered with a red baize cloth and piled with papers, pamphlets,
      and odd volumes, occupied the centre. An old arm-chair, its seat filled
      with a set of blue books, was drawn up near the fire. The mantelpiece was
      bare, save for a few pipes and smoker&rsquo;s odds and ends. Above was pinned a
      broad-sheet almanac issued by some Reform organisation. Nowhere appeared
      any attempt at adornment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard sat in his round-backed wooden chair, opened a couple of letters
      that had come by the evening post, and then drummed with his fingers on
      the table in a preoccupied way. The setting of his face was too stern to
      express pain, and yet the deep vertical furrow between the brows and the
      tightly compressed lips indicated thoughts far removed from joyousness. At
      last he shook himself, brushed his hair from his forehead with a hasty
      gesture, and drawing a great breath, which ended like a sigh, separated
      some papers from the chaotic mass, and set to work on them, pen in hand.
      He worked for half-an-hour, only pausing to fill and light a pipe, and
      then with a yawn he rose and went through the communicating door into the
      adjoining room. A camp bedstead and the bare bedroom requisites were all
      that it contained. His seven years of affluence had brought him no sense
      of the minor luxuries of life. His personal tastes were as simple as when
      he lodged in the little top-floor-back in the working folks&rsquo; street in
      Sunington.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his watch he drew from his waistcoat pocket the card he had received
      at Stepney: &ldquo;Lady Phayre, 15 Queen&rsquo;s Court Mansions.&rdquo; He had forgotten her
      existence. He glanced at the card rather contemptuously, tore it across,
      and threw it into the grate. Then he undressed and slept the sleep of the
      weary man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he began his breakfast alone, although the table was laid
      for two. As he ate, he ran through his correspondence, and jotted down
      notes in his pocket-book. He was a busy man, particularly occupied just
      now with heavy committee-work on the Council, and sundry organisation
      schemes connected with the League, and every moment was of value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the door opened, and Lizzie entered. She did not meet his
      following glance, but came forward with sullen, downcast eyes, and
      silently took her place at the table. The seven years had pressed upon her
      with the weight of fourteen. The devil had walked off with his own beauty.
      Although she was barely thirty, the plump freshness of youth had gone. The
      pink cheeks had paled and grown flabby; round contours had fallen into
      puffiness; the pout of the soft lips had relaxed into unlovely looseness
      of mouth marked by marring lines. A common, slatternly woman, with loose
      untidy hair and swollen eyelids, and dressed in an old morning wrapper,
      she was as unlike the rosebud bride of Sunington as the light is unlike
      the darkness; and yet by the inexorable law of development she was the
      same woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She poured herself out a cup of tea and broke some dry bread on her plate.
      Neither had spoken. Goddard&rsquo;s brow darkened a little as he went on with
      his breakfast and his papers. She stole from time to time a shifting
      glance at him. The expression of absorbed interest on his dark face
      irritated her. The dead silence became unbearable. Suddenly she thrust
      back her chair a few inches, and struck the table sharply with her
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake say something, can&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; she cried half-hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard looked up gravely and laid down his pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I say to you, Lizzie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything. Curse me, nag at me&mdash;anything; only don&rsquo;t sit there as if
      I was the scum of the earth and you God Almighty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you have broken your promise once more. What else can I tell you?
      You can&rsquo;t expect me to be pleased, and I see no good in cursing and
      nagging. So I hold my tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I was dead,&rdquo; said Lizzie bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard shrugged his shoulders. He had done his best according to his
      lights, and he had failed. Sometimes his heart echoed her wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have only yourself to thank,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I? I&rsquo;ve not got you to thank for anything. Oh dear, no! You know you
      hate me. You never did care for me. Even when we was first married you
      cared for your dirty old politics more than you did for me. Oh, why didn&rsquo;t
      I marry Joe Forster? He has three big shops now, and can hold up his head
      as much as you can, for all you&rsquo;re a County Councillor and have your name
      in the newspapers. And what good does that do to me, I&rsquo;d like to know?
      It&rsquo;s all your fault, every bit your fault, and you drive me to it; you
      know you do, and you&rsquo;d be glad if I dropped down dead now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not a new story. Her words had no longer power to move him to
      anger. He accepted her grimly as a burden he had to bear through life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We made a mistake in marrying, Lizzie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We both found it out
      long ago. I was not the sort of man you wanted, and perhaps I ought to
      have remained single. But I have done my duty by you honestly, and&mdash;so
      help me, God&mdash;I always shall. What is it you want that I do not try
      to give you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many and many a woman, when she has been asked that question, the helpless
      question across the league-sundering gulf, has answered, aloud or dumbly,
      in a great yearning: &ldquo;Love, a breath of passion, a touch of tenderness.&rdquo;
       But in Lizzie that craving had never been deeper than the bloom on her
      cheek, and with the bloom it had perished. There are natures too common
      for the need of love, which is an instinct upwards of the soul. Instead,
      she answered querulously: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you give me some money, and let me
      live away, somewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To do God knows what with yourself? Not I, unless you would like this
      sort of thing.&rdquo; He took from among the circulars with which he was daily
      deluged a chance-sent prospectus of a Home, and put it before her. She
      glanced at it, and then crumpled it up fiercely, and threw it into the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to do that with me, you&rsquo;d better look sharp, I can tell
      you,&rdquo; she cried, trembling with sudden rage. &ldquo;How long have you been
      making that little plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no plan. You could only go in there of your own free will. My only
      plan is to shelter you here, and make life as happy for you as you will
      let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie sniffed contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you send for that thing for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It came quite by chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a damn lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent forward, took her wrist, and looked at her sternly between the
      eyes, which lowered, abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I never tell lies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I tell you that you shall never go
      to such a place unless you wish to. But you shall stay in my house. And
      listen to me. If this goes on much longer, I shall have to engage a
      special attendant to live here, who will watch you like a cat. It will be
      a disgrace for you that you can well spare yourself. So be warned, and
      turn over a new leaf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, opened the morning paper, and skimmed through the news summary.
      Lizzie rubbed the wrist that he had held in an unconsciously tight grip,
      and then she began to whimper. But her tears had lost their effect upon
      Daniel. They came with maudlin frequency.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she broke into a great spluttering sob. &ldquo;I have been miserable
      ever since little Jacky died. I wish I had died with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The name of the child, dead three years before, touched the man&rsquo;s heart.
      Of the two, perhaps he had felt the loss the more. Standing behind her, he
      laid a hand upon her shoulder, and said in a rough, tenderer tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was hard, my girl. But you are not the only one. Other women have been
      left desolate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And other women have wished they were dead. I expect most of &rsquo;em
      do. It&rsquo;s beastly to be a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; he said grimly, resuming his newspaper. &ldquo;You
      had better try and make the best of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant entered with his boots, which she placed on the hearthrug.
      When he had laced them up he stamped them into ease and looked more
      cheerful. A man&rsquo;s moral tone always undergoes a subtle change with the
      donning of the morning boot or the evening slipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be back for supper early this evening,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so you won&rsquo;t be
      lonely. Now be a good girl. Do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply, although he had spoken kindly and forgivingly, and she
      knew from past experience that the subject of the last night&rsquo;s slip would
      not be alluded to again. As soon as he had gone, she drew from her
      dressing-gown pocket a soiled penny novelette, and settled down to her
      idle morning by the fireside. In the afternoon Emily came, a weary,
      shrivelled woman, to remain with her for a few hours. For some time past
      Daniel had made the sisters a secret allowance, as compensation for loss
      of time in their dressmaking business, on the condition of their keeping
      Lizzie company. Society in the ordinary sense she had none. It was the
      loneliness and idleness that had crushed her. At first it had seemed a
      grand thing to wear pretty dresses, and keep her hands white, and give
      over all the work of the house to the servants. Now the habit of sloth was
      ingrained. She had no occupation, no interests. Even her girlish fondness
      for finery was gone. The costume that gave her least trouble to put on was
      the one she selected. Like the once free-swimming sea-anemone she had
      grown encrusted to her rock, stretching out lazy tentacles. When her
      cousin arrived she was still attired in the old dressing-gown and
      down-at-heel slippers she had thrust on as she got out of her bed. Emily,
      who was precise and businesslike, hurried her off with an indignation not
      staled by custom, to dress herself decently. During her toilet she made
      the usual confession to Emily with pleas in mitigation, and the usual
      indictment of Daniel. But Emily was not sympathetic. She banged in the
      drawer, where she had been arranging Lizzie&rsquo;s slovenly kept under-linen,
      and pulled out another viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have married a man like father,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sort of
      husband you should have had, who would have pulled you out of bed by your
      hair and given you a good sound hiding. Daniel&rsquo;s thousands of miles too
      good for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie turned round and faced her passionately, straining at the ends of
      her stay-lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish sometimes he would beat me. There! I&rsquo;ll make him do it one of
      these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan&rsquo;s not the man to treat his wife like a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He treats me like a tabby-cat&mdash;beneath his notice. He has always
      done it. I may be a silly fool, but it doesn&rsquo;t require much intellec&rsquo; to
      know when folks look upon you as the dirt beneath their feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the dirt ought to be grateful when a man like Daniel condescends to
      put his foot upon it,&rdquo; replied Emily with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you marry him yourself?&rdquo; said Lizzie witheringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elizabeth Goddard, you&rsquo;re no better than a fool,&rdquo; returned Emily. &ldquo;And if
      you&rsquo;ve nothing pleasanter to say, I&rsquo;ll go back home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As on many previous occasions, the threat moved Lizzie to tears, then to
      reproaches, finally to entreaties and submission. When peace was made they
      went off on a shopping expedition to Kensington High Street, where Lizzie,
      to make amends, bought her cousin a bonnet, and interested herself in a
      discussed readjustment of trimming. But outside a newsvendor&rsquo;s Emily
      pointed with her umbrella to an item in the contents bill of a Radical
      evening paper: &ldquo;Dan Goddard at Stepney&mdash;Enthusiastic Reception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I see,&rdquo; said Lizzie petulantly. &ldquo;I suppose you think I ought to
      fall down and worship him when he comes back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her ill-humour returned, and she regretted the bonnet&mdash;an additional
      grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for him I&rsquo;m blessed if I&rsquo;d ever come near you,&rdquo; said Emily
      in the discussion that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it happened that when Goddard came home he found his wife in a fit
      of sulks. The experiment of a domestic evening failed, as it had done so
      many times before. She replied monosyllabically to his attempts at
      conversation, refused point-blank his offer to put her into a cab and
      drive her to a theatre&mdash;a wild delight of past years&mdash;and
      retired to bed at nine o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard mounted to his own den, and plunged into his work with the zest of
      a man who has conscientiously acquitted himself of an irksome duty, and is
      free to apply himself without scruple to more congenial occupations.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was the Tuesday
      luncheon-hour. The diningroom of the political club was thronged with
      hungry councillors from Spring Gardens, and politicians to whom the weekly
      meetings of the Council were a matter of concern. The air buzzed with
      eager talk. There was a continual going to and fro between the tables&mdash;greetings,
      handshakes, hurried conversations between lunchers and passers-by. Elation
      over an important measure successfully carried through was the prevailing
      tone, encouraging grandiose imaginings. London was to have its
      hanging-gardens, like Babylon of old, and the streams that water the New
      Jerusalem would take a lesson in limpidness from the Thames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard sat at a table with three others, who were thus forecasting the
      municipal millennium. He listened with a smile. Had he not just pricked
      the visionaries with kindly satire in his review article on Extremism?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all <i>ad majorent L. C. C. gloriam</i>,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;That way madness
      lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an impatient laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a reactionary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a practical man,&rdquo; said Goddard. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like confusing means with
      ends. Matthew Arnold was right in calling faith in machinery our besetting
      sin. We have beatified too many of our institutions already, and made them
      too much puffed up with conceit for work-a-day purposes. We are always in
      danger of drifting into the idea that the work exists for the
      glorification of the instrument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about our ideals?&rdquo; cried one. &ldquo;They are as necessary for the
      life of the party of progress, as the reverence for decayed antiquity is
      for that of the Tories. Man is a dreaming animal, and his dreams inspire
      his actions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hence this crazy society,&rdquo; said Goddard, with a laugh. &ldquo;I understand now.
      But man has reason to direct his inspirations. Have your ideals by all
      means, but see they are true ones&mdash;that they can be attained without
      the sacrifice of minor commonplace reforms. Best to build up your ideal as
      you go along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Synthetic socialism&mdash;a good title,&rdquo; murmured another, a journalist
      in the labour interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ezekiel has done it all before you, with his line upon line, precept upon
      precept,&rsquo;&rdquo; remarked Goddard. &ldquo;They did know something down in Judee. But
      you&rsquo;ve begged the question as to the glorification of the County Council.
      You want to make London flow with milk and honey. Is that your real end?
      Or is it to pose as a composite middle-class Jehovah? I think the latter.
      No. I believe in progress. I have given up my life to the cause of it, and
      I will fight for it till the last breath in my body. But I will look upon
      myself and any institution to which I belong as the merest tool in the
      hands of social evolution.&rdquo; Here the discussion was interrupted by the
      waiter, whose temporary ideal was the perfection of his guidance of
      Goddard in the matter of sweets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will have another helping of beef,&rdquo; said Goddard. &ldquo;I am hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That accounts for your paradoxical humour,&rdquo; said the journalist. &ldquo;I have
      often noticed it.&rdquo; Goddard nodded and leant back in his chair. Just then
      he caught sight of Aloysius Gleam, the pink of neatness, with an orchid in
      the buttonhole of his frock-coat, scanning the room through his eye-glass.
      When his glance met Goddard he came forward with the expression of a man
      who has found the object of his search. Pending the arrival of the beef,
      Goddard rose and advanced to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I should find you,&rdquo; said Gleam. &ldquo;I want to talk to you
      seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Goddard. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the very man I was longing for. Perhaps
      it&rsquo;s about the same matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Gleam, with a twinkle of amusement. &ldquo;You broach it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rumour about Ecclesby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rumour?&rdquo; asked Gleam, becoming grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The strike. There is a big storm brewing for the near future, I&rsquo;m afraid.
      Haven&rsquo;t you heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a suggestion,&rdquo; returned Gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a report from Willaston&mdash;he is the League secretary there&mdash;forecasting
      probable events. Nothing is definite. I thought perhaps you might have
      heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gleam shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is wrong? New machinery, and Trades Union and Employers&rsquo; Federation
      at loggerheads about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not machinery. Worse than that. Sweating, out-work. Simple tyranny.
      Here is the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of it. It will blow over,&rdquo; said Gleam, having looked
      through the letter. &ldquo;Wait a bit though,&rdquo; he added, with a quick glance.
      &ldquo;Ecclesby is in the Hough division, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Goddard. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Willaston wrote to me in
      particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep a look-out,&rdquo; said Gleam. &ldquo;Cleaver and Flyte are the leading
      firm there. Oddly enough, I am connected with them in a roundabout way in
      the City, through Rosenthal, you know. And then there are Flood &amp; Sons
      in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an encyclopaedia you are!&rdquo; said Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aloysius Gleam laughed, and curled his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That reminds me of my mission,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you called upon Lady Phayre?&rdquo; Goddard disregarded the
      apparent non sequitur, and replied with an air of surprise&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I to do in ladies&rsquo; drawing-rooms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit, drink tea, and talk political gossip,&rdquo; said Gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t brought up to it,&rdquo; replied Goddard.
 </p>
    <p>
&ldquo;I have never done it, and
      therefore it is not to be done. Sound doctrine for a Progressist. Well,
      Lady Phayre is a little indignant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? For not taking advantage of a piece of empty politeness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Phayre&rsquo;s politeness is never empty when it is directed towards a
      member of the party. Her name is not unknown to you?&rdquo; Goddard admitted
      that the fame of Lady Phayre had reached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Gleam, &ldquo;I advise you, as your oldest political friend,
      to go and see her. She&rsquo;s a charming woman, attached heart and soul to the
      party, and can give you help in the most unexpected ways. There never was
      a successful politician yet who despised the assistance of women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many have got into rare messes through women,&rdquo; said Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More have got out of them by their aid,&rdquo; retorted Gleam convincedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she would be rather astonished if I turned up, wouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said
      Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gleam broke into a laugh. There were unlooked for simplicities in Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, my dear man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that, as Lady Shepherdess of the
      party, Lady Phayre expects you to go and pay her your homage. Hang it,
      man! she paid you the compliment of journeying all the way to Stepney to
      hear you speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goddard&rsquo;s face assumed an air of perplexity, oddly at variance with its
      usual stern, resolute expression. Then the obstinacy in his nature
      asserted itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s very kind of Lady Phayre, and I feel flattered. But I&rsquo;ll stick
      to my own ways. Call me bear, or Goth, or what you like&mdash;I have no
      relish for false positions. You know who I am and all about me, so I don&rsquo;t
      mind talking frankly to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood rose to his face as he said this, and he held up his head
      somewhat defiantly. He had barely as yet divested himself of the
      uncomfortable impression of masquerading in his well fitting clothes, and
      of incongruity in refined table adjuncts. If these occasioned a worrying
      feeling of unfamiliarity, the sense of a wrong element in a lady&rsquo;s
      drawing-room was still more galling. Gleam was keen enough to perceive
      these workings of false pride, and he bore Goddard no malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; he said with a smile. &ldquo;Perhaps you are right in your
      pig-headed way. I mustn&rsquo;t keep you from your lunch. Good-bye. I&rsquo;ll bear
      Ecclesby in mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook hands, waved a salute to one of the men at Goddard&rsquo;s table, and
      after exchanging a few words with a party near the door, went away.
      Goddard returned to his beef, which was getting cold, and, after the meal,
      retired with his three companions to the smoking-room, where an argument
      arose that banished Lady Phayre from his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could have resisted Aloysius Gleam&rsquo;s persuasion to the crack of doom;
      but when the stars in their courses began to take up the matter, he was as
      helpless as Sisera. If he had marched straight out of the club, he
      possibly might never have spoken to Lady Phayre again. But the stars
      turned his steps aside to the Central News tape-machine in the strangers&rsquo;
      waiting-room, and there he found himself suddenly face to face with her
      sitting&mdash;a dainty vision&mdash;in an arm-chair near the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face brightened as she saw him, and she made a slight forward movement
      in expectation of his advance. Goddard could do no less than acknowledge
      these manifestations of friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Mr. Gleam in the club? They are keeping me such a time
      waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said Goddard, an announcement which the page-boy
      came up that moment to confirm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a nuisance,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre. &ldquo;I want a couple of ladies&rsquo; tickets
      all in a hurry for the House. I have a country girl staying with me, and
      have only this evening free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at Goddard with a little air of concern. Now when Lady Phayre
      looked at a man like that, she simply rested all her responsibilities upon
      his shoulders. They became the man&rsquo;s own personal affairs. Goddard was a
      man like any other. He reflected instinctively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say I could get some men in the club to ballot for you&mdash;if
      you don&rsquo;t mind waiting a little longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you really try?&rdquo; she said, her eyes beaming gratitude and apparent
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; said Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his absence she turned over the advertisement pages of a railway
      time-table, and devised in her mind various club improvements that might
      conduce to the comfort of lady strangers. When he came back she rose, saw
      from the look of pleasure on his face that he had been successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen Jervons, the member for Twickenham. He undertakes to get
      half-a-dozen men to ballot for you; so if they are successful the orders
      will be round at your house before five o&rsquo;clock. Will that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautifully,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre: &ldquo;a thousand thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it won&rsquo;t be very interesting,&rdquo; said Goddard&mdash;&ldquo;the Army
      Estimates will be on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre cheerfully: &ldquo;the child will be
      pleased, whatever it is. I shall take a novel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply, but looked down at her from his superior height, one
      hand grasping his hat and stick, the other on his hip. There was a tiny
      pause. So Lady Phayre looked up at him and smiled. There was just the
      faintest gleam of mockery in her eyes, a transient consciousness of the
      feminine magic that had made the huge, powerful man do her bidding with
      the lightness of an Ariel. She put out a delicately gloved hand from her
      sealskin muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saving up a quarrel with you, Mr. Goddard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for not
      having been to see me. Surely you could have spared just one half-hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was so much frankness and charm in her tone and in her attitude, as
      she stood with half-extended hand, and head slightly inclined to one side,
      that Goddard reddened with a sense of boorishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am hardly a society man, Lady Phayre,&rdquo; he said lamely, his pride not
      allowing him to formulate the more conventional apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. She had known men positively intrigue for the right of
      entrance at her door, and here was one refusing the privilege. He was a
      curiosity. Her self-pride was pricked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean my frivolity frightens you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I am not as
      frivolous as I look, I assure you. I can talk even earnestly at times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is my friends. Well, some of them are as unbutterfly-like as
      bats. But if you don&rsquo;t like a crowd, avoid an &lsquo;at home&rsquo; day, and come any
      afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you honestly care whether I come or not?&rdquo; asked Goddard bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, considering that I have gone out of my way to ask you twice,&rdquo; she
      replied, rather staggered, &ldquo;you might have taken my sincerity for
      granted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her chin a little, and put back her hand into her muff. Goddard
      realised that he had been rude. The desirable aspects of Lady Phayre&rsquo;s
      friendship also began to dawn upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Lady Phayre,&rdquo; he said, after an awkward pause. &ldquo;You see what
      a bear I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The admission brought out again smile and hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I come and see you?&rdquo; he added whimsically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you honestly want to?&rdquo; she asked, echoing his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should very much like to, indeed,&rdquo; said Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, Lady Phayre sent down her card, from behind the grating, to
      Aloysius Gleam. He came up after a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you think got me the tickets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the vaguest idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Goddard,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Mabel,&rdquo; said Gleam, turning to the country girl, who was listening
      to a technical statement by the War Secretary with rapt attention, &ldquo;Lady
      Phayre is like Providence: her ways are inscrutable.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII&mdash;A DEMAGOGUE&rsquo;S IDYLL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>oddard went away,
      after paying his first visit to Lady Phayre, with a wondering mind. His
      original intention had been to make it as short as he possibly could: he
      had remained nearly a couple of hours. He could scarcely believe his
      watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delicate play of mind of a pretty and highly cultured woman was a
      novelty as rare to him as the bubbling of champagne in his apprentice
      days. He had gone expecting to endure the inane small-talk which his
      second-hand experience persuaded him was the inevitable adjunct of a
      lady&rsquo;s tea-table; he had found conversation upon all the subjects dear to
      him invested with a charm such as he had never before imagined. Talk on
      social questions had ever been with him a deeply serious matter. Lady
      Phayre had brought into it an unknown lightness, a sparkle, a mental
      keenness, against which his own intellect sharpened itself, and at the
      same time a bewildering waywardness that never allowed him to forget she
      was a woman. In short, Lady Phayre was a revelation. He walked along with
      a buoyant step, like a man who has made a new discovery that promises to
      change the old order of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short interval a pretext arose for repeating the visit. He was
      careful to magnify its importance for the sake of self-justification. But
      on the third occasion he owned to himself that he had called out of sheer
      desire for Lady Phayre&rsquo;s society.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood, hat in hand, in the drawing-room waiting for her, he had a
      feeling of misgiving curiously like that of a boy who is fearful lest he
      is taking too great advantage of a kindly neighbour&rsquo;s invitation to visit
      his fruit garden. Her smile of welcome, however, as she entered, reassured
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good of you to come. I had a bit of a headache, and was beginning to
      mope by myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I too felt as if it would do me good to have a talk with you,&rdquo; said
      Goddard, seating himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t mope?&rdquo; said Lady Phayre, lifting her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord, no!&rdquo; he exclaimed with a laugh. &ldquo;I have too much to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were a man,&rdquo; sighed Lady Phayre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Goddard. &ldquo;If you were, I don&rsquo;t think I should have wanted
      so much to come and see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how am I to do you good? Will tea comfort you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would,&rdquo; replied Goddard, smiling&mdash;&ldquo;out of your gossamer
      tea-cups, and with imperceptible films of bread and butter. They seem
      outside of the uses of the weary, work-a-day world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have them, and until they come you shall tell me all the news.
      I have heard nothing for two days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened his budget. It was somewhat heavy. The lighter trifles of
      political gossip were beyond his range; but Lady Phayre listened
      attentively, adroitly brought him to his own part in current affairs. He
      had just been on a committee of the League, in the north of England,
      inquiring into the working of the Factory Act for women in certain trades.
      He had visited many white-lead works, where he had felt daunted by the
      inevitableness of the sacrifice of human health and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But manufacturers are obliged to enforce precautions,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard waved his hand impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No precautions will ever prevent it. The poison gets in everywhere. The
      dust is in the air&mdash;impregnates the food, finds its way into the
      baths, creeps in through the tightest overalls. Women should not be
      allowed in it&mdash;and yet they must work. One feels paralysed before
      these deadly trades. I saw some women&mdash;young and vigorous&mdash;who
      had &lsquo;got the lead,&rsquo; as they call it&mdash;death written on their faces,
      one going to have a child; that is one of the horrible parts of it&mdash;to
      be poisoned before one is born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take it to heart,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre in a low voice. She was touched
      by his earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I do,&rdquo; replied Goddard. &ldquo;If a man doesn&rsquo;t, he had better leave
      Social Reform alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Phayre handed him his tea. The strong, heavily veined hand
      outstretched to receive the cup, conveyed to her a suggestion of strength
      which she could not help associating with the earnestness of his tone. For
      a moment Lady Phayre felt, not unpleasantly, the insignificance of her
      sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, when I see men like you devoting your whole lives to the
      cause of others, I feel very small and petty,&rdquo; she said, upon the impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel looked at her in some confusion. No one had ever paid him such a
      tribute before. Coming from Lady Phayre, it gratified more than a man&rsquo;s
      vanity. He laughed awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I do so much good after all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are a far
      more important person, really. You are in the swim of everything&mdash;the
      pivot of the party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the party!&rdquo; cried Lady Phayre. &ldquo;Sometimes I get so tired of it. It
      seems to be all concerned with means&mdash;the end lost sight of. Nothing
      day after day but little moves, and counter-moves, and intrigues, and this
      person&rsquo;s speech, and that person&rsquo;s vote. Oh, Mr. Goddard, when you get
      into Parliament you will never develop into the typical party-man&mdash;the
      lobbyist, and asker of questions, and mover of amendments. &lsquo;You are so
      different from most of the other men who come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke sincerely for the moment. By the light of Goddard&rsquo;s earnestness
      she glanced ashamedly at her own political dilettanteism. A momentary
      conception of nobler effort passed through her mind. Womanlike she
      projected these higher subjective workings into increased regard for the
      man. When Goddard took his leave, he was unaware how far he had advanced
      in Lady Phayre&rsquo;s good favour; but he realised that something new and
      helpful had come into his own life.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this he became a constant visitor at Queen&rsquo;s Court Mansions. Usually
      he chose the times when Lady Phayre was alone. In the general society he
      now and then met in her drawing-room, he felt shy and constrained,
      blundered in his speech, and grew hot with anger at imaginary errors. A
      proud man, he was ashamed at himself for envying the ease of manner of
      other men. In a mixed assembly he was helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not coming to your omnium gatherums any more,&rdquo; he said once to Lady
      Phayre. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to talk to these people. Their ways are natural
      to them. I have to put them on, and I put them on crooked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know how to talk to me,&rdquo; she replied with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are different,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know who and what I am. You are good
      enough to take me just as birth and circumstances have made me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent forward and looked him sweetly in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be to others just as you are to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an utter impossibility!&rdquo; he exclaimed quickly, with a flash in his
      eye, at which her face flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps not quite the same,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I like you to come
      occasionally and show yourself at my little receptions. It completes them,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Goddard withdrew his decision and strove to adapt himself to society
      ways. But it went sorely against the grain. The hour&rsquo;s discomfort over, he
      hurried home, threw his dress-coat on a chair, and smoked a pipe in his
      shirt-sleeves with feelings of intense relief. Other invitations, which
      Lady Phayre&rsquo;s patronage necessarily procured for him, he refused with
      obstinate persistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do far more good, both to myself and others, if I put in a spare
      evening at a working-man&rsquo;s club,&rdquo; he said to Gleam, who was persuading him
      to take advantage of social opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The months went by. Goddard worked with a zest which even he had not known
      before. In the little comedy of their lives Lady Phayre played Egeria with
      nice discrimination. Daniel imperceptibly acquired the habit of setting
      forth all his schemes and ambitions for her approval. His strenuous life
      had been so single-purposed that he had retained many simplicities, and
      his nature came fresh to receive her sympathy. The first time he handed
      her the manuscript of a review article he blushed like a schoolboy. It was
      a pleasant time. He was too ingenuous to suspect pitfalls in his path.
    </p>
    <p>
      His domestic life continued its usual course. Lizzie had spells of
      soberness and quasi-repentance, alternating with periods of outbreak.
      These latter, however, were growing more frequent. To Daniel the
      asperities of everyday existence became more and more external. A dogged,
      almost Philistine sense of duty kept him uniformly kind and considerate;
      but he had long since ceased to regard her as one fulfilling any of a
      wife&rsquo;s functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bond of union between Lady Phayre and himself was formed by the
      increasing rumours of trade disturbances at Ecclesby, and the consequent
      complications introduced into the choice of a Parliamentary candidate for
      the Hough division, in which it was situated. The sitting member was daily
      expected to accept the Chiltern Hundreds. The Conservatives had secured a
      strong candidate. The Liberal organisation was divided. The influential
      local man desired by the moderate section would be opposed by the Labour
      vote in favour of an Independent candidate. To save a three-cornered
      contest, the advanced section had approached Goddard. All through the
      summer, things had remained at a deadlock. Lady Phayre, with feminine love
      of intrigue, had stimulated her friends at Ecclesby to exert their
      influence in Goddard&rsquo;s favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going down there in the autumn,&rdquo; she told him one day, &ldquo;and I shall
      open the campaign in person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But before she could fulfil her promise, the trade storm burst in
      Ecclesby. A general strike and lock-out declared itself. Attempts at
      compromise failed hopelessly. Terms of agreement, suggested by a board of
      arbitration, were indignantly rejected by both sides. A long, bitter
      struggle seemed inevitable. Daniel watched its progress with intense
      interest. Principles of relation between Labour and Capital were at stake,
      in whose cause he had fought from those far-off days when he had carried a
      three-legged stool to Hyde Park on Sunday afternoons, and harangued his
      casual and apathetic audience. It was a small strike when compared with
      the great contests that have convulsed industry of late years; but its
      result would have far-reaching consequences. He thirsted to join in the
      battle, but the delicacy of his position as regards the constituency kept
      his tongue silent. And as the days went on, and he saw that the Trades
      Union was less and less able to hold its own, he chafed in London, and
      poured out his heart to Lady Phayre.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, one memorable day, he found himself in a cab speeding to her, all
      too slowly. A great delight was thrilling through his veins. Visions of
      fierce conflict, victory, fulfilled ambition danced before his eyes. He
      sprang up the steps of Queen&rsquo;s Court Mansions, tingling with the news he
      was carrying to his&mdash;to his what? He did not know. An impulse, whose
      sanity he never questioned, brought him hither irresistibly. During the
      long interview with the strike leaders, from which he had freshly come,
      his thoughts had turned to her, had identified the anticipation of telling
      her with the pride of the moment. The gift of feminine sympathy was still
      so new to him that he rushed to it with a child&rsquo;s indubitative eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the flat opened as he reached the landing, and Lady Phayre
      appeared, dressed for walking, in a dark fawn costume trimmed with fur and
      a toque to match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look pleased,&rdquo; she said, smiling at his dark, flushed face and
      shining eyes. &ldquo;Whatever has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going down to Ecclesby to lead the strike,&rdquo; he said, panting a
      little. &ldquo;The Trades Union people have just been to me, and I have come to
      tell you at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The news pleased her, the homage flattered her. She beamed gracious
      appreciation upon him, invited him to enter and acquaint her with the
      details. They both remained standing in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The union is badly organised, is gradually
      losing hold on the men. No one seems able to take the lead. They are
      making a mess of it. I was afraid they would. I was only telling you so
      lately. So they have begged me to come and help them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre, with kindling cheeks, &ldquo;they want a strong man
      with a strong will; a leader of men.&rdquo; She put out her hand impulsively. &ldquo;I
      am so proud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words and the touch of her hand quivered deliciously through Goddard&rsquo;s
      frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the biggest thing I have been called upon to do yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of
      course I have no official position in the matter; I cannot approach the
      masters in any way. But the Union has guaranteed free action; placed
      itself unreservedly in my hands. All the responsibility is practically
      mine. I shall win,&rdquo; he added, after a pause, during which he took three or
      four strides backwards and forwards in the room. &ldquo;Somehow I feel it. I
      have eternal justice on my side. Oh, to think what success will mean for
      all these people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for you, my friend,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre. &ldquo;Win, and there&rsquo;s Parliament
      for you with a triumphant majority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her for a moment open-mouthed. She saw a new intelligence
      dawn in his glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me you never thought of that?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said simply; &ldquo;it had not struck me.&rdquo; Lady Phayre turned her face
      from him, and buttoned her glove. There are some feelings which rush into
      a woman&rsquo;s eyes that it is not advisable to show to the man who evokes
      them. When she had slipped the last button she looked up at him smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re the only man in England who could have said that. When do
      you commence operations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day after to-morrow. There will be a big open-air demonstration. Then
      I&rsquo;ll settle down to regular work&mdash;visiting, picketing, speechifying,
      overhauling the books, agitating for help from cognate trades. I shall
      have my hands full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He prepared to take his departure, seeing that she was going out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can walk part of the way with me, if you like,&rdquo; she said graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an undreamed-of honour. Save his mother and his wife, he did not
      remember to have walked in the street with any woman. He strode by her
      side proud and happy. Their way lay through Hyde Park. The October leaves
      shimmered like golden scales in the afternoon sun, shedding a glory around
      him. The few passers-by seemed non-existent. The great stretch of lawn
      rolled on either side towards the just visible white house-tops. In front,
      the chequered path of the burnished avenue. From time to time his
      companion raised her delicate face to him. A slanting beam caught the
      light of her eyes and the gold tints of her hair under her dainty toque. A
      strange, unknown feeling stole upon his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great silence and splendour had fallen over life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Lady Phayre who broke the silence at last. Her voice was sweetly
      silvery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I came to Ecclesby, could I be of any use to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would only have to look as you look now,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and there is
      nothing you couldn&rsquo;t help me to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      Lady Phayre began, stopped abruptly as a little tremor shook her shoulders
      delicately, then recovering herself, broke into a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall look ever so much more businesslike, I assure you. I&rsquo;ll go and
      make friends with the wives. It will be useful against canvassing time. I
      am an old campaigner in electioneering, you know. But I have never taken
      an active part in a strike. It will be a new thing for the political woman
      to do. I am always seeking after something new. I must have been an
      Athenian in past ages&mdash;an Athenian of the Athenians&mdash;and my soul
      got so impregnated that it has never been able to free itself. I wonder if
      they would let me make a speech, Mr. Goddard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will ask the Union,&rdquo; he laughed, following her unwittingly into the
      lighter track she had started upon. &ldquo;But will you really come and help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I thank you?&rdquo; said Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Post me up in all the ins and outs and technicalities,&rdquo; she replied
      brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up his parable, and told her of shifts and piece-work, and the
      intricacies of sliding-scales of wages, and the complications of the
      trade. And, in truth, it was a parable. For the idyllic hour of Goddard&rsquo;s
      life had come, and air, and trees, and sun, and words all lost their outer
      sense, and became informed with hidden meaning.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;WITH THE HELP OF LADY PHAYRE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he outskirts of
      Ecclesby, where the &ldquo;quality&rdquo; live in villas decorously withdrawn from the
      roadway, and screened from public view by the garden-trees, are as
      pleasant as those of any idle town given up to homing the Great Retired.
      The traveller by road might fancy he was entering a Midland Cheltenham or
      Leamington, so soothingly genteel are its approaches. But a few minutes&rsquo;
      walk, past smaller villas, then semidetached villas, then villas clustered
      together like reeds in a pan-pipe, then unpretending red-brick jerry-built
      cottages, would bring on a gradual disillusion, preparing him for the
      hopeless disenchantment of the town itself. A long black street, untidy
      with little shops and public-houses standing here and there amid a row of
      poor, dirty dwelling-houses, mounts in an undecided curve from the railway
      station, and suddenly, at the top of the hill, twists sharply round into
      the High Street, where brand-new hotels and brand-new shops try to look
      smugly unconscious of the world below the corner. But the shops have to
      supply that world&rsquo;s wants, and all the bravery of window fronts cannot
      give the illusion of refined and luxurious patronage. There is not much
      pleasure to be got out of Ecclesby. Even its theatre is up a dingy
      side-street, and has a threepenny gallery and sixpenny pit. The fair
      follies and vain amenities of existence find no place there. It is given
      over to labour grim, absorbing, inevitable. At certain periods of the day
      the High Street, Market Square, and Union Street, which cuts laterally
      through its heart, at the top of the rise, are quite deserted. The great
      bells ring, and the gaunt countless-windowed factories situated all around
      in labyrinthine tangle of mean streets disgorge into the main thoroughfare
      the pale work-grimed population they had swallowed up. The town becomes a
      swarming hive. The shops are thronged. From the ever-swinging doors of
      public-houses comes the roar of voices, borne upon gusts of air saturated
      with alcohol and shag-tobacco. There is little diversity of type or
      costume. The town exists for one industry. The population drifts from the
      grim Board School inevitably, unquestioningly into the grim factory. If
      the next transition is not into the grimmer workhouse by the railway
      station, they account themselves happy. Each man acts, dresses, eats,
      hopes, thinks, and, at last, looks like his neighbour. And the girls and
      women work in the factories too. The streets are alive with them. They
      march along in knots of three or four, bareheaded, bare-armed,
      red-shawled, shrill, nonreticent of speech. The doorways of hundreds of
      dwellings in squalid by-streets are dissonant with the clamour and
      picturesque with the dirt-encrusted chubbiness of children.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is Ecclesby when the factories are working, and the hum of strange
      machinery strikes the ear on passing by the yawning gateways. But when
      Goddard went there a blight had fallen on the town. The factories for the
      most part were silent, the streets depressing with unjoyous idleness. The
      fact that the strikers had gone in procession the day before with a brass
      band that played the Dead March in &ldquo;Saul&rdquo; before the employers&rsquo; villas had
      not produced lasting exhilaration. The very deadly boredom of leisure,
      apart from anxiety as to issues, was wearing down the adult population. To
      lean against a street corner, pipe in mouth, hands in pockets, in taciturn
      converse with one&rsquo;s mates, is pleasant enough for a few hours on Saturday
      afternoons; but to persist in it all day long, and day after day, induces
      considerable lassitude of the flesh and infinite weariness of the spirit.
      What the deputation had told Goddard was true. The men were growing sick
      of the struggle. Whispers of submission already floated in the air. The
      Trades Union officials were steadily losing their influence. The
      employers&rsquo; agents had been busy among them, spreading nerve-shaking
      reports as to the impregnable position of the firms. The Union was small,
      poor, badly organised. The strike pay was scanty. Much of it was spent,
      almost unwillingly, in drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Severe distress already began to make itself felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard brought a practised intelligence to grasp the situation, and
      realised how fully his were victory, if it were gained; also how great a
      responsibility rested upon his shoulders in urging the continuance of the
      strike. It meant the extravagant love or execration of a teeming town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you advise us to give in, we&rsquo;ll do so,&rdquo; said the secretary of the
      Union, a careworn man with iron-grey hair and lantern-face. They had been
      discussing affairs in the office. The fire had gone out in the tiny grate,
      and the dimness of a gathering wet evening crept in through the uncleaned
      panes. Goddard was silent a moment. The man&rsquo;s tone was so hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the joy of battle rose within him, and was mingled strangely with the
      radiance of Lady Phayre&mdash;a thrilling sense of his own strength,
      trebled by the wine of her influence&mdash;and he leapt from his chair and
      brought his two great hands down on the secretary&rsquo;s timorous shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win this, mate. We&rsquo;ll carry it through, and have the firms on their
      knees. Ruin is staring them in the face. They will have to climb down.
      Man, we are not fighting machinery. If we were, I would say &lsquo;throw it up.&rsquo;
      Man has never bested a machine yet, and never will. It&rsquo;s mere brute force&mdash;who
      can hold out longest. And they can&rsquo;t hold out longer than we. I&rsquo;ll stake
      my soul upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the capital behind them,&rdquo; murmured the secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pack of damned lies!&rdquo; cried Goddard. &ldquo;You can take it from me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A glow appeared on the grey face as Goddard&rsquo;s splendid assurance gained
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll follow your lead past starvation, sir,&rdquo; he said in a voice hoarse
      with new-born hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knowledge of Goddard&rsquo;s arrival had quickened the general apathy. His
      visible presence in the streets was a draught of strength. The brave words
      he spoke to casual knots of men turned their sullenness to hope, and were
      passed from lip to lip after he had gone by. Before the great meeting in
      the afternoon, he had already lifted the tone of the strikers. They were
      conscious of a new force among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he mounted the platform in the densely packed market-place, a
      spontaneous cheer arose to greet him. When he retired, after a long,
      vigorous speech, he knew that he had accomplished the first and
      all-important part of his task&mdash;the winning of the men&rsquo;s confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then began a period of intense, unremitting work. For beyond the
      commonplaces of strike organisation, picketing, fund-distribution,
      speech-making, and the like, the continuous maintenance of the moral
      strength of a whole community by sheer force of will involved infinite
      devotion. He had to carry things with a high hand. The Employers&rsquo;
      Federation invited a conference. For a while he had high hopes. The hour
      came, and the whole town awaited the issue in breathless suspense. Goddard
      sat alone in the little office of the Union, chafing at his necessary
      exclusion from the discussion. At last the representatives of the Union
      returned, the secretary bearing a paper in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we agree?&rdquo; he asked, giving it to Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced over it, and his face darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I make this public?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, if you think it best,&rdquo; replied the secretary, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, it&rsquo;s over, any way,&rdquo; said one of the representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Goddard did not hear. He flung open the window and brandished the
      paper before the crowd assembled in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men! listen to the result of the conference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read the document in a loud, even voice. The employers had offered a
      few trivial concessions, a slight rise in skilled wages; but the
      principles were untouched. He hurried through the last clause; and before
      there was time for a cry to come from below, he tore the paper across and
      across with a passionate gesture, and scattered the pieces on the heads of
      the crowd. The men, who had listened in silent submission to what they
      thought were the final terms agreed upon, burst into a great cheer. The
      dramatic touch had quickened the revulsion of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Goddard, turning round to the representatives. &ldquo;I
      have burned your ships for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A day or two afterwards Lady Phayre appeared upon the scene. She was
      coming on business&mdash;not pleasure, she had informed her friends, and
      accordingly laid house, carriages, and servants under requisition. Mr.
      Christopher Wentworth, her host, was the leading member of the Progressive
      League in the neighbourhood, and a humble vassal of Lady Phayre. His
      wife&rsquo;s interests in life extended from her husband&rsquo;s throat, which was
      delicate, to his digestive organs, which were dainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as you don&rsquo;t take Christopher to open-air meetings, Rhodanthe,&rdquo;
       she said to Lady Phayre, &ldquo;and give him bronchitis, or make him late for
      dinner, you can do exactly what you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want Christopher. He would be sadly in the way,&rdquo; said Lady
      Phayre, reassuringly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make him stay at home and write letters and
      collect funds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She summoned Goddard to wait upon her. He had already received two or
      three daintily penned letters from London, and had been eagerly looking
      forward to this one from Ecclesby itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her alone in the bright morning-room, radiant as Romney&rsquo;s
      Bacchante head of Lady Hamilton that hung on the wall, and wearing the
      simplest of elegantly-cut blue serge costumes. Her sunniness almost dazed
      his eyes, accustomed lately to the gloom of sordid homes and pinched
      faces. She was eager to hear all the details of the situation; drew from
      him an exhaustive report. Her presence lifted him into a sanguine mood,
      filled him with a vague sweet sense of the triumph of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let me tell <i>you</i> something,&rdquo; she said when he had finished.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say I am not a woman of character. I have been bursting with it
      since you came into the room, and I have waited patiently. I have arranged
      a surprise for you. I am going to institute at once a children&rsquo;s halfpenny
      tea-house. Haven&rsquo;t you heard anything about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad.&rdquo; She laughed, and clapped her hands. &ldquo;It has all been going
      on under your very nose. My own idea. It is the children that suffer so.
      They don&rsquo;t know why they should bear with hunger. So I am going to give
      them a great breakfast or tea, with as much bread and butter as they can
      eat, for a halfpenny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the funds?&rdquo; asked Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the greatest stroke of all,&rdquo; replied Lady Phayre
      enthusiastically. &ldquo;I have inveigled a grant out of the League, and the <i>Evening
      Chronicle</i> has promised me to start a subscription list to-night. I am
      negotiating for the use of the Salvation Army Barracks, and Evans and
      Williams are going to contract for the meals. Haven&rsquo;t I been industrious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have,&rdquo; said Goddard. &ldquo;It will be a tremendous help to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind my having kept it a secret from you?&rdquo; she asked after some
      further discussion; &ldquo;I wanted it to come as a surprise to you&mdash;to
      cheer you with a little unexpected help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her hands in her lap, and bent forward with a pretty air of
      humility. A faint note of wistfulness in her voice increased its charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Goddard could say was that the scheme had been perfect. He tried to
      say more, but his unaccustomed brain refused to formulate in words
      subtleties of emotion. But before leaving he had a sudden inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel a different man since I have seen you,&rdquo; he said abruptly; &ldquo;I was
      inclined to be harassed and despondent. Now&mdash;&mdash; &lsquo;Strange how a
      smile of God can change the world.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what you seem to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Phayre turned away her head and blushed. She knew it was like a
      school-girl, but she could not help it. No one had ever told her quite
      that before. The glimpse into spiritual things rather frightened her. She
      did not know whether to be angry or pleased at being enraptured. Like a
      wise woman, she decided upon indefiniteness. But she could not hide a
      certain softness in her eyes as she bade him good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be in the Salvation Army Barracks at nine this evening. If you
      could help me just a little&mdash;unless you are too busy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He promised, delighted, and went away on house-to-house visits in the dark
      byways of the town, spreading everywhere, with great voice and hearty
      gestures, the overflow of his happiness. He felt himself filled with the
      spirit of victory. One man refused to be comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strikes never did no good,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard drew himself up, towered over him, and rated him for
      pusillanimity. If he could have spoken his inmost heart, he would have
      shouted&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, don&rsquo;t you see that I am unconquerable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so for the next few days the men were held together and lifted by the
      one man&rsquo;s happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Children&rsquo;s Tavern was a great success. Lady Phayre worked
      indefatigably, serving herself, with other helpers, behind the trestles
      ranged round the great bare hall and creaking beneath the load of great
      tea-ums, mountains of bread and butter, and, in the morning, steaming pans
      of porridge. Goddard loved to make his way through the crowd of clamorous
      unwashed children to the place where Lady Phayre, deliciously fresh in
      white bib-apron and turned-back cuffs, was busily dispensing viands,
      receiving pence and halfpence from grubby little hands, and paying for
      countless moneyless urchins from a great private store of coppers by her
      side. And after the press was over, she would emerge from behind the
      trestles and walk up and down the hall with him discussing affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had she seemed so near to him as now when a common interest united
      them. But in Goddard&rsquo;s fresh, newly-awakened idealism, it was not her arm
      that brushed his on a common level, but it was her wings that touched his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he would meet her in the streets, on a round of visits among
      such homes as she knew; sometimes he would see her sitting in the
      dog-cart, with her host, on the outskirts of a crowd he was addressing.
      Once she even persuaded him to accept a dinner invitation at the
      Wentworths&rsquo;. She grew more into his life daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strain of his position, as arbiter of the struggle, grew more intense.
      Rumours of the larger firms being backed up by the great capitalist
      Rosenthal were gaining hopeless credence. At another fruitless conference,
      one of the employers boasted that they could maintain a lockout for a
      couple of years. Goddard summoned a great mass-meeting of operatives, and
      gave the manufacturer the lie with passionate vehemence. Once more he
      imposed his will upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was fighting this battle as he had never fought before. Every aim of
      his life seemed to be merged in the issue. Not only were the great
      principles of the rights of labour at stake, not only the present and
      future happiness of this great community, but his own career seemed to
      hang in the balance, and, in a strange, uncomprehended way, his credit
      with Lady Phayre.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the London world began to clamour for Lady Phayre. A rift was
      threatening to appear in the Progressive lute. &ldquo;You only can put things
      straight,&rdquo; wrote Aloysius Gleam. &ldquo;Fenton and Hendrick have bumped each
      other&rsquo;s heads in the dark, and they are angry with one another, and we are
      all taking sides. You must bring them to kiss and make friends over your
      dinner-table.&rdquo; So Lady Phayre deliberated. She had one very good reason
      for remaining at Ecclesby; but, on the other hand, she had fifty little
      feminine ones for leaving it. The work she had taken in hand, the
      Children&rsquo;s Tavern, was in capital going order. She had already found her
      own services, as attendant, superfluous. She was free to resign the charge
      of it into competent hands. Why should she stay? It was not often that
      Lady Phayre did not know her own mind. At last she compromised. She would
      pay a visit to London, to effect the desired reconciliation, and then
      return to Ecclesby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like leaving you at all,&rdquo; she said to Goddard, the evening before
      her departure. &ldquo;It seems as if I am deserting you. But I shall make haste
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, do!&rdquo; said Goddard pleadingly. &ldquo;The people have grown so fond of you.
      And you are such a help to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To atone for her defection, she had dismissed the carriage, and allowed
      him to see her home after the tea at the Salvation Army Barracks. It was
      already night, but the moon had risen, and lent a tenderness to things.
      Lady Phayre was glad of its aid, for it was on her conscience to leave
      Goddard with comfortable impressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done very little,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have advised me at every turn,&rdquo; said Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have advised yourself while talking to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, I could not have got on without you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe it then, if it pleases you,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;You can write me a
      daily account of things, if you like&mdash;and I will go on &lsquo;advising&rsquo;
      you. Will that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too good to me,&rdquo; he said fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on a little in silence. Then she asked him how much longer he
      thought the strike would last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another fortnight must see the end of the employers&rsquo; resources,&rdquo; he said
      with conviction. &ldquo;The game of bluff can&rsquo;t last longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you sure that the Rosenthal story is a myth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sure as I am that the moon is shining on your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon the word, the moon disappeared behind a cloud. Lady Phayre started,
      and touched his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a bad omen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Daniel laughed. Omens had no place in his downright philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Juliet calls the moon inconstant,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre gaily. &ldquo;So we
      won&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only have to keep the men up till then,&rdquo; said Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will do it, Mr. Goddard,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It will be a great
      victory, and we shall all be so proud of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Goddard went to sleep that night with hope thrilling through his
      dreams. And he woke up the next morning and went about his work, and
      longed for Lady Phayre. She might be back in five days.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before the five days were up, Rosenthal&rsquo;s support of the Employers&rsquo;
      Association became a matter of public certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not believe it,&rdquo; shouted Goddard to the grey-faced secretary.
      &ldquo;Nothing but the sight of Rosenthal&rsquo;s cheque would convince me. If you
      give in now, you&rsquo;ll be throwing up the most glorious victory labour ever
      won in this country. You are fools&mdash;wretched, cowardly, credulous
      fools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the tide of conviction had set in. He was powerless against it. He
      strove with the passionate rage of his nature, exhausted himself in wild,
      furious effort. The end came with overwhelming rapidity. Goddard felt that
      he had lost his Waterloo.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL MOMENTS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>oddard mounted the
      stairs of Queen&rsquo;s Court Mansions with a heavy tread. He was physically
      tired, and his heart was sullenly sore. He had felt himself irresistibly
      drawn hither, though his pride hated the ordeal of confessing his failure
      to a woman, especially to Lady Phayre. The old, fierce class feeling was
      ineradicable. She was above him. Success, brilliance alone could keep him
      on her level. Failure brought him down. A glimmering realisation of this
      had come to him in the train, and he had pulled up his coat-collar
      angrily, and doggedly resolved to swallow his humble-pie to the last
      mouthful. But it did not occur to do otherwise than drive straight to her
      from the railway station.
    </p>
    <p>
      He deposited his bag and ulster in the hall, and followed the servant into
      the drawing-room. The first glimpse of it cheered him. The subdued light,
      the dancing fire, the warm tones of carpet and curtains, the cosy
      atmosphere, the charm of perfectly harmonised surroundings, struck
      gratefully upon his sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Phayre dropped on the hearthrug the book she was reading, and rising
      quickly, made a step or two to meet him. Her eyes were wide, in great
      concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how tired you are looking. Come and sit down, in the big chair by the
      fire. It was good of you to come. See, I have been waiting for you&mdash;with
      Monmouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, and directed her glance downwards to the white cat which had
      stalked up and was rubbing itself, with arched back and outstanding fur,
      against Goddard&rsquo;s legs. He stooped and patted the beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am just done-up,&rdquo; he said, sitting down wearily in the chair, and
      throwing back his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking exhausted. A pallor appeared beneath his dark skin; his
      eyes were rather sunken, thus bringing into strange relief his somewhat
      massively hewn features. A strand of black straight hair fell from the
      side-parting across his forehead. Lady Phayre, standing with one hand on
      the back of her chair, regarded him pityingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had anything to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me when. Ah! I see you haven&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll order you something in the
      dining-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began; but she interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must, to please me. I can&rsquo;t bear to see you so tired. You will feel
      quite a different man. And a small bottle of champagne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Man has not been born of a woman who could have refused Lady Phayre, when
      she spoke with that coaxing charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard&rsquo;s face softened into assent, and he followed her with his eyes, in
      a dumb, wondering way, as she went to give the necessary directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never quite familiarised himself with his surroundings in that
      room. It always seemed a corner of Paradise that had somehow got left
      behind upon the unlovely earth. The feeling had never been so strong as at
      present. With his brain throbbing from the painful emotions of the day,
      his eyes still dazed by the various scenes&mdash;the mean, squalid
      streets, the grim, closed factories, the poverty-stricken homes, the idle,
      sullen men lounging at street-corners, the crowd of gaunt, unresponsive
      faces at the meeting&mdash;and with his body exhausted with fatigue and
      hunger, this warm nest of exquisite peace and comfort was deliciously
      unreal. Even Moumouth, luxuriously coiled on his velvet cushion, seemed a
      creature of a different sphere from that of the lean grey cats he had seen
      darting from doorways across alleys, preceding the appearance of
      red-shawled women. And the voice of Lady Phayre hummed like far-away music
      in his ears, and her delicate womanly sympathy was like soft hands against
      his cheek. It was almost a dream. He leaned forward, elbows on knees, his
      fingers through his hair. He longed for her to come back, so that he could
      tell her of the failure. Somehow, it no longer struck him as an ordeal.
      The magic of her presence had charmed away his repugnance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned, knelt down on the long fender-stool, and spread out her
      hands before the blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head sideways towards him as she spoke. Her attitude was
      alive with feminine grace and charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are as good as you are beautiful,&rdquo; he said, in reply to her
      hospitable remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met his full glance, and smiled contentedly. The blunt sincerity of
      the tribute compensated for its lack of the finer imaginative shades.
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Then she raised her eyes again, but this
      time with sad expectancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke out in a kind of groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over. I needn&rsquo;t tell you that. You got my letter this morning,
      and you must have guessed from my wire this afternoon. We give in
      to-morrow unconditionally&mdash;after all these weeks of struggle and
      sacrifice. It is the most crushing blow labour has ever had. And I&rsquo;ll
      stake my existence another week would have seen them through. Rosenthal is
      no more going to finance these firms than he is going to finance me. It
      has been cruel. I have been working at it since six o&rsquo;clock this morning.
      It has been like trying to fly a kite with a cannon-ball at its tail. At
      the meeting this afternoon I did all I knew. I have never lost my head
      with passion before. They were all like dead men; went away dragging their
      boots. Some of them cursed me. Managers came round me afterwards. &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t
      I know? The strike fund was exhausted.&rsquo; As if I was ignorant of it! &lsquo;Two
      more days would see the end of it.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;In God&rsquo;s name, see the two
      days out.&rsquo; They shook their heads; were going to announce surrender then
      and there; but I managed to make them put it off till the morning. And
      then I came away&mdash;eating my heart out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He set his teeth and glowered at the fire. The story of the defeat had
      brought back the bitterness in all its intensity. Lady Phayre did not
      speak, instinctively knowing that, with him, silence was the truest
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bitter part to me,&rdquo; he continued, with note of passion that vibrated
      through the woman, &ldquo;is, that if I could have had a hundredth part of the
      grip on them to-day that I had a week ago, I should have brought them
      through. I know it as I know water goes down hill. I have failed. It is my
      failure. I have been responsible for all these poor creatures&rsquo; sacrifices
      during the past weeks; and now all the poverty, hunger, despair, for
      nothing. You saw what it was a few days ago. You should have been there
      this morning. I saw a man seize a bit of bread and treacle out of a
      child&rsquo;s hand and begin to devour it&mdash;like a wolf&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t
      stand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Phayre looked at him quickly, and then for the first time noticed a
      slight bruise and an abrasion on his forehead. She drew her own
      conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the awful misery of it all,&rdquo; said Goddard between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre in a low voice, &ldquo;sorry to my inmost heart;
      but I am sorrier for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you mustn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; cried Goddard passionately. &ldquo;Think&mdash;you
      couldn&rsquo;t mean it. It would be inhuman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only too human,&rdquo; murmured Lady Phayre.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to speak, when the maid-servant announced that the supper was
      ready; so, instead of replying to Lady Phayre&rsquo;s murmur, he remained
      silently wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      She led the way into the dining-room, where a dainty but substantial meal
      was spread&mdash;a piece of salmon with crisp salad, a truffled pie, a
      cold fruit-tart. Only one place was laid. It had seemed to Lady Phayre she
      could give him kinder welcome if she sat by him as he ate than if she went
      through the formal pretence of joining him at the meal. Then she wondered,
      in the feminine way, whether he was cognisant of it. The servant uncorked
      the champagne and retired. Lady Phayre sat down near him, resting her
      elbow on the table. At first he leaned back in his chair, looked at his
      plate, then at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel too sick at heart to eat. The thought of those poor starving women
      and children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your going without food will not fill their mouths, you know,&rdquo; said Lady
      Phayre in sympathetic remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I feel my own personal humiliation too,&rdquo; he said ungraciously,
      as if forcing out the admission. &ldquo;One may as well be honest. It&rsquo;s the
      biggest thing I&rsquo;ve set my hand to as yet, with everything depending upon
      it. And to have to throw it up when victory was staring one in the face!
      It is maddening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent forward impatiently and took up his fork. He laid it on his plate,
      and turned to Lady Phayre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the only person in the world I could say that to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were half whispered, but she looked at him full and clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are yourself, I suppose&mdash;your good opinion dear to me,
      your sympathy a necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all that because you know I believe in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes fell beneath his gaze, which was stern and yet half pleading.
      Then she raised them again slowly, with the delicious upward sweep of her
      lashes, and repeated&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thrill ran through the man; his dark, powerful face lit up. Lady Phayre
      shifted her attitude, and broke into a silvery laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all this time you are not eating. If you don&rsquo;t begin at once I shall
      go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goddard laughed shamefacedly, with a vague consciousness that he had been
      ungracious in not having commenced before. He helped himself to the
      salmon. After the first mouthful or two his aversion to food disappeared,
      and he went on eating with the appetite of a bigframed, very hungry man.
      With the exception of a sandwich and a glass of beer at the station bar
      before starting, he had eaten nothing since his early breakfast. The food
      and the wine restored his physical well-being. Lady Phayre looked on,
      pleased, she could scarcely tell why. These big, earnest men were
      sometimes like babies&mdash;so helpless, if left to themselves. She tended
      on him now and then in a pretty way without leaving her seat, passed his
      plate, handed him the little silver jug of cream, and, when the meal was
      over, fetched from a cupboard a box of cigarettes. Like a man unaccustomed
      to delicate feminine ministrations, Goddard accepted them rather
      tongue-tied, with a certain tremulous bashfulness. The little hospitable
      actions, so homely and therefore charming to a man of gentler nurture,
      were to him full of a rare exotic sweetness. All through the meal she
      exerted herself to talk to him brightly of little things, incidents that
      had brought them into pleasant contact during the late struggle. He
      finished his cigarette, and they returned to the drawingroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard stood before the fire, with his hands in his jacket pockets. The
      sense of personal humiliation still smouldered within him, but the raging
      of the flame had been subdued. He felt that he could hold up his head
      again. And it was the loyal tender sympathy of that woman in the low
      arm-chair before him who had brought it about. He had never known before
      how a woman could be a necessity in a man&rsquo;s life. Till then he even had
      not realised how imperious were the cravings for her, in spite of the
      revolt of his galled pride, during that weary journey back to town. She
      looked so fair and exquisite. His eyes met hers. But something more than
      her beauty stirred the eternal masculine within him, and when he spoke his
      voice vibrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you always treat me like this, Lady Phayre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it much to do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is growing to mean everything in the world to me. I have lived a rough
      life away from women&mdash;ladies&mdash;women like you. Hitherto it has
      never occurred to me that I was not self-sufficing&mdash;that I could ever
      look to a woman for help. A year ago I should have laughed at it&mdash;thought
      it a sickly fancy of the hyper-sensitive semi-men in novels. But I have
      needed you this day, and I came to you because something stronger than I
      impelled me. And you have given me new life to-night. Do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were looking so worn out and sad when you came in, that it pained
      me,&rdquo; said Lady Phayre, non-committally.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Goddard&rsquo;s ear detected a soft note in her voice. He came near to her,
      sat down on the fender-stool, almost by her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are all women not like you? What a great beautiful world it would
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any woman would have done the same; given you of her best to cheer you.
      Besides, I was grieved&mdash;you have worked so nobly. Everybody has been
      talking about you&mdash;of nothing else. I felt so proud I had been
      working with you in my poor way&mdash;and I had set my heart upon your
      winning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have failed miserably,&rdquo; said Goddard. &ldquo;Therefore you ought to feel
      I was unworthy of your trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that. It hurts me,&rdquo; she cried quickly, really wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard&rsquo;s heart came into his eyes. The goddess had come down from the
      far-off pedestal where he had worshipped her, and was by his side,
      throbbing woman. He had a strange intoxicating sense of her nearness. He
      raised his hand and touched the edges of the feather firescreen she was
      holding in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is hard to believe that my success or my
      failure is of concern to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it hard?&rdquo; she asked in a low voice, looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it means more than my wildest dreams could ever bid me hope,&rdquo; he
      replied, with a sudden rush of passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Lady Phayre could find no words to answer,
      conscious that her muteness was an expectation of fuller avowal.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Goddard&rsquo;s brain was whirling with wonder and strange joy. His hand
      sunk a hair&rsquo;s-breadth, and touched her knee. The contact was electric to
      him. He drew his hand away quickly, and, rising to his feet, stretched
      himself, as if he had awakened out of a dream. He could scarcely realise
      what had happened. His enthusiastic practical life had not been fertile in
      psychological moments. Lady Phayre looked up at him with angelic
      sweetness. Generally more graceful than seductive, she was bewilderingly
      woman at this moment. Suddenly, with an instinct of self-preservation, she
      rose too, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I believed in you, you know. Our little faiths are of moment
      to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her light tone saved the situation. Talk was resumed, but it did not flow
      so spontaneously as before. At last Goddard rose to leave. She was
      solicitous as to his rest. Had he any more work to-night?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going straight home,&rdquo; he answered, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her hand for a long time and looked her in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will sleep happier than if you had not come to me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! God bless you,&rdquo; he said, rather huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he squeezed her hand, and went hurriedly from the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X&mdash;LADY PHAYRE THROWS HER CAP OVER THE WINDMILLS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t had been a quick
      rough grasp, bringing to Lady Phayre a new conception of handshakes. It
      had not been violent like that of certain per-fervid ones among her
      friends, forcing the rings into her delicate flesh; but her hand tingled,
      and the tingling mounted her arm and died away in a flutter in her bosom.
      Involuntarily she held up the hand in front of her, saw that it trembled a
      little, and then laid it against her cheek. A swift consciousness of the
      act brought a flush to her face. But instead of drawing away her hand, she
      moved it slightly so that her lips touched the palm, and there it stayed
      while she gave herself up to a day-dream. And the smile rose into her eyes
      which no one has ever seen in a woman&rsquo;s, except when she has been taken
      unawares; which only comes when she is alone, and is looking half
      tremulously, half amusedly into her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, however, the smile grew dim with a gathering moisture. She was
      not a woman to whom tears came readily. She was surprised and glad. They
      were a delicate test of the sincerity of her emotion. A drop hung on the
      lower lid for a moment and fell upon the back of her fingers, losing
      itself among the rings. Her heart melted over Goddard. Failure for him was
      different from failure for other men. The wherefore of this conclusion she
      did not argue out, content with the assurance of its truth in her own
      mind. The great battle, into whose side-issues she herself had been drawn,
      was lost. She was sorry. But she had spoken truly when she had said she
      was sorrier for him. The fallen cause was merged in the defeated man. Her
      thoughts drifted towards plans of consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very still, silence only broken by the whirr of the little leaping
      flame jets in the fire. The white cat rose from the hearthrug, stretched
      himself, stole noiselessly over the pile carpet to the centre of the room,
      and then, after a dubious wag of the tail, returned to slumber. Lady
      Phayre did not change her attitude. Her occupation engrossed her. She was
      compounding balm for Goddard&mdash;a new and wondrous panacea, whose
      secret she had just discovered&mdash;an extract of many feminine simples
      as old as the leaves on the Tree of Knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden opening of the door caused her to start with a foolish hope
      that it might be Goddard returning. But the neat maid-servant, in her
      subdued voice, announced Mr. Gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came forward eagerly, his dry equable face glowing with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Goddard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was too preoccupied with his business even to linger his usual moment
      over her finger-tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been here. Why do you want him?&rdquo; The question was in a breath with
      the reply. Something had happened. She caught Gleam&rsquo;s excitement, half
      rose in her chair, and looked up at him anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell him some news. Great news. Glorious news. I am the only one who
      has got it. The enemy have been weakening all the time&mdash;a rift within
      their lute. Rosenthal has backed out. Cleaver &amp; Flyte are in a panic&mdash;Rosenthal
      was behind them, you know. The others can&rsquo;t stand alone. It&rsquo;s utter rout!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s too late!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Phayre, with a ring of dismay in her
      voice. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t. Not yet,&rdquo; replied Gleam animatedly. &ldquo;The managers won&rsquo;t declare
      till to-morrow morning&mdash;unless they are fools. But I have more
      precise news still. You did not let me finish,&rdquo; he laughed apologetically.
      &ldquo;They will give in all along the line if the men hold out another
      four-and-twenty hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must hold out,&rdquo; cried Lady Phayre. &ldquo;Oh, why isn&rsquo;t Goddard there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better he should be here&mdash;if I could only get at him. Wiring
      couldn&rsquo;t have been definite enough. It&rsquo;s not safe. Let me track him down,
      and off he goes by the midnight train, or the newspaper train, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will win,&rdquo; cried Lady Phayre exultantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Come, see, conquer. As easy as lying. That is why I have
      killed three cab horses under me to find him. I was in despair. I knew he
      had left Ecclesby. At his house they assured me he was not in London&mdash;did
      not expect him for a couple of days. No news at the clubs&mdash;his
      offices. Then I came here. Thank Heaven, he is in London, at any rate. If
      I can&rsquo;t find him, some one else will have to go down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Goddard lose his triumph after all? He must be found. Besides, they
      would not believe any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of going myself, <i>en dernier ressort</i>,&rdquo; said Gleam
      rather quizzically, &ldquo;just as I am. I think they would believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would the masters. A member of Parliament in dress clothes going about
      at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning! Besides, you would catch your death of
      cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed playfully, but she was trembling all through with suppressed
      joy. The knuckles of her hand, that held a futile ball of a handkerchief,
      were white. There was a little pause. She looked on the ground for a
      moment, then she lifted her long lashes, and regarded him half-shyly, with
      a smile playing round her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you say if I told you where you can find him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything,&rdquo; cried Gleam. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Midland Grand Hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She told the lie with astounding charm. He whipped up his hat from the
      table and turned towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did I not come to you at once? You are not a woman, but an Immortal.
      A crisis&mdash;a time of difficulty&mdash;and you come out of a rosy cloud
      like an Homeric goddess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Phayre smiled on him divinely. She held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t keep you. I am as eager as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another minute she heard the wheels of his departing cab in the street
      below. She broke into a little ringing laugh: he had gone so promptly and
      unquestioningly on his fool&rsquo;s errand. A woman in an exalted condition of
      mind has a queer sense of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wild fancy had seized her. It had grown into an irrepressible desire.
      Her woman&rsquo;s wit had worked swiftly. The lie had mounted to her lips on
      wings of triumph, and spread radiance over her face. No wonder Gleam was
      enraptured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women who are in the habit of throwing their caps over windmills find it
      as monotonous as anything else after a time; but for one who has never
      done it before, the act is accompanied with a rare exhilaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Phayre had lived a bright but perfectly exemplary life. No breath of
      scandal had ever rested upon her name. Sir Ephraim had cloyed her with
      affection, and hitherto she had regarded amatory offerings with a young
      confectioner&rsquo;s serene indifference to puffs. If she dared now and then to
      flout at convention, she was only exercising the privileges of her
      position. No one could find a word to say against it. To have driven to a
      politician&rsquo;s house at night to deliver a political message was a
      commonplace of propriety. But to take the message of victory to the man
      she loved, knowing, with a thrill that quivered from her feet to her hair,
      that the message would contain also the openly avowed gift of herself&mdash;that
      set matters on a totally different plane. It was wild, daring, unutterably
      sweet. The breathless moment that followed the lie was the supreme point
      of happiness in Lady Phayre&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to a writing-table, took a sheet of the crested,
      delicately-scented paper, and wrote a hurried line, which she enclosed in
      an envelope and thrust in her corsage. Then she rang for her maid, and in
      a few moments was speeding across London in a hansom cab. The cold air
      caught her face, filling her with a joyous sense of vitality. She
      pictured, glowingly, the little scene that would take place. First, his
      look of wondering delight at her presence, then the illumination on his
      face when she gave him her breathless message. There would be just time to
      deliver it, if he was to catch the midnight train. The letter she would
      slip into the letter-box. It would be found after she had left. If it was
      forwarded to him the next day, so much the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      She loved him. It was a new, wild sensation to her. The gradual drifting
      towards the rapids had been pleasant, though not unaccompanied by certain
      trepidations and misgivings. This evening had brought her to the edge, and
      the swirl fascinated her. For once Lady Phayre had lost her head. And yet
      there was method in her wildness. She felt herself worshipped, longed for,
      saw the man standing in passionate helplessness on the other side of the
      social gap between them. It was her prerogative to stretch the bridge
      across. In the midst of all the excitement, Lady Phayre was deliciously
      conscious that she was doing it gracefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind was blissfully unheedful of the route. Crowded thoroughfares,
      dreary squares, long, gaunt streets&mdash;it was all the same to her. She
      lay back in a corner of the cab, felt the letter stiff against her bosom,
      beneath her sealskin jacket, and surrendered herself to her sensations.
      They were those of an angel of mercy committing a rapturous indiscretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the cab stopped at the given number of the quiet street where
      Goddard lived. Bidding the cabman wait, she ran up the steps and rang the
      bell. For a moment she hesitated with the letter in her hand, fingering it
      nervously. Then, with a little throb, half-joy, half-fear, she thrust it
      into the letter-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant came to the door and stared at the visitor. Lady Phayre&rsquo;s heart
      beat so fast that she could scarcely speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Goddard&rsquo;s upstairs, ma&rsquo;am. I&rsquo;ll fetch him,&rdquo; said the servant; and she
      ran up the stairs, leaving Lady Phayre standing in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a slatternly slip of a girl, in a print dress. The thought of
      men&rsquo;s incapacity in the domestic economies brought a superior smile to
      Lady Phayre&rsquo;s lips. She forgave him, on account of his sex, for being left
      to wait in a draughty passage. But the dining-room door was ajar, showing
      a light within. There was no reason against her entering, her hand was
      upon it, when it was suddenly opened wide, and, in the full light appeared
      the figure of a woman with sodden features, dull eyes, and loose, untidy
      hair, dressed in a dirty flannel dressing-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second they stood watching one another. Then the woman made a step,
      and reeled sideways against the wall. She was drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; are you?&rdquo; she cried in a thick
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Phayre was transfixed with horror. She shrank back, just as Goddard
      rushed down the stairs. He had heard his wife&rsquo;s speech. It was an awful
      moment. At the sight of him the woman cowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay in that room!&rdquo; he thundered at her; then he slammed the door, and
      still gripping the knob, stood with livid features and heavily coming
      breath, staring into Lady Phayre&rsquo;s white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here? What madness brought you?&rdquo; he said hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of his voice addressing her was an awakening shock to Lady
      Phayre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she exclaimed, the disgust and revolt of her soul finding its only
      expression in an inarticulate cry. And then she instinctively fled towards
      the street door.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Goddard overtook her in two or three great strides. She shrank into
      the corner, put up her hand as if he were about to touch her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go. Don&rsquo;t come near me. Don&rsquo;t speak to me. It is horrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s horrible,&rdquo; he replied fiercely. &ldquo;But it is my curse, and not my
      fault, that I have a wife like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife, your wife?&rdquo; she said in a queer, faint voice. &ldquo;That&mdash;that
      woman your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not think it was my mistress?&rdquo; he exclaimed with bitter
      coarseness. &ldquo;To come to <i>her</i> after leaving you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She recovered her composure with a strong effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will trouble you to open that door for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slid back the latch, held the door open for her to pass out, followed
      her, and, shutting it behind him, stood with her on the steps. Then,
      before she had time to descend, he seized her by the wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What madness made you come to this house? Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her first impulse was to wrench herself free and rush down to the waiting
      cab, so as to fly from the loathed spot, and be alone with her sickening
      mortification. But he held her too firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said again sternly. &ldquo;You would not come here without some
      good reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go my arm. You are hurting me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said, in a softer tone, dropping her wrist. &ldquo;The hell of
      indoors followed me out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Phayre at that moment hated him intensely. If it had been a mere
      personal service to him, rather than perform it she would have called to
      her safe-conduct into the cab the policeman who was pacing the solitary,
      windswept street. But she reflected on the gravity of the issue. Mastering
      her repugnance, she told him in a few curt sentences the object of her
      mission. The longing for escape tingled through every fibre in her body.
      As soon as the last word of the hated task was spoken, she shuddered, flew
      down the steps, and rushed into the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of Queen&rsquo;s Court Mansions, after she had paid her fare, her
      heart stood still with a sickening recollection. She had left the letter
      behind in the box. For a moment she thought of driving back to claim it;
      but that was impossible. She crawled up the stairs and went to bed, her
      brain reeling with rage, disgust, and humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard stood bareheaded on the steps till the cab had disappeared in the
      darkness, and then let himself in with his latch-key. He went into the
      dining-room. Lizzie, lying half asleep on the couch by the fire, turned
      her glazed eyes towards him as he entered. Her hair was squalidly loose,
      her face bloated, her figure shapeless, her dirty dressing-gown half open,
      her stockings wrinkling around her ankles. The room smelt of spirits; the
      furniture was awry; the table-cloth was askew, and on it were crumbs of a
      half-eaten Bath bun, a dirty handkerchief, and a copy of a penny
      novelette, lying open at a great stain of grease.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wave of indescribable loathing passed through the man. A savage desire
      leaped from his heart to snatch the sofa-cushion from under her and stifle
      her with it as she lay there, but it ended in a great lump in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you to go to bed,&rdquo; he said fiercely. &ldquo;Go at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose to her feet and staggered, unable to walk. If she had fallen to
      the ground, Goddard felt that he could not have touched her. She dropped
      back on the couch. He rang the bell and the girl appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call cook and put your mistress to bed at once. I am going back to
      Ecclesby to-night. I don&rsquo;t know how long I shall be away. I shall wire to
      Mrs. Smith to come here to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl went out to fetch the cook. Lizzie looked at him with stupid
      gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think I believe you&rsquo;re a-going to Ecclesby? You&rsquo;re going to that
      Piccadilly Circus woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goddard sprang forward, caught her by the loose collar of her dressing
      gown, and shook her till the stuff tore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to kill you?&rdquo; he said, between his teeth, glaring at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was frightened, and began to whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard stood for a moment looking at her. Then he passed his hand through
      his hair in a passionate gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God!&rdquo; he cried, in a low, trembling voice, and then strode out of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought mechanically his still unpacked bag, his overcoat and
      necessaries, and went out into the night. At St. Pancras Station he found
      Gleam waiting on the platform. He was conscious of the Member asking him
      for certain explanations concerning the Midland Grand Hotel and Lady
      Phayre, and of listening to details of the leakage of secrets, Rosenthal&rsquo;s
      defection, to congratulations, encouragement, adieux as the train moved
      off, but it was all a phantasmagoria in which his intellect worked
      independently of himself. The glorious news he was carrying, the certain
      victory that was to crown his hopes and ambitions, the thousands of lives
      whose destiny he was bearing in his hands&mdash;all loomed like vague
      shadows at the back of his consciousness. But his brain was on fire with
      passionate love for Lady Phayre, and wild hatred of the woman from whom he
      had just parted. If man ever carried the fires of hell in his heart it was
      Goddard, that night, as he was on his way to realise the first great
      ambition of his life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;RECONSTRUCTION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he victory was
      complete. The sudden collapse of the firms caused a sensation all over the
      country. The newspapers were ringing with his name. He was the hero of the
      hour. At Ecclesby he was the hero for all time. His first appearance after
      the announcement of the terms of settlement was a signal for extravagant
      demonstration. Men shouted themselves hoarse, and fought to shake hands
      with him. Women wept upon each other&rsquo;s necks and shrilled out blessings.
      One, mad with joy, threw her arms around him and kissed him. A torch-light
      procession, headed by two frenzied bands, playing &ldquo;See the Conquering Hero
      comes,&rdquo; carried him in triumph through the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the time his heart glowed with the intoxication of success and popular
      worship. But when the shouts of the crowd had ceased ringing in his ears,
      the glow faded like a false glamour, and left him face to face with grim
      realities, before which all else seemed shadowy. As soon as he reached
      London, he went with whirling thoughts to Queen&rsquo;s Court Mansions.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he should say to Lady Phayre he did not know. All that he had defined
      was a fierce hunger to see her again, a wild longing to throw himself at
      her feet. The dormant passion of the man had awakened and shook him to the
      depths of his nature. His love for her had flowed so calmly, had quickened
      so imperceptibly, had maintained so smooth a surface with passionate
      depths so unsuspected, that when the sudden chasm met its course, it
      dashed down an overwhelming cataract that swept him headlong into unknown
      abysses. The blood swirled through his veins as he stood waiting outside
      the familiar door. The servant opened it. Lady Phayre was unwell, was not
      receiving any visitors. &ldquo;Is she in bed?&rdquo; asked Daniel rudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is keeping her room, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her that I wish to see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant retired, and returned with the message that Lady Phayre could
      not possibly receive, and would not be well enough to do so for some time.
      He had to depart, raging with disappointment. He went home, shut himself
      up in his room, and wrote to her. The days passed, and he received no
      reply. A second letter met with similar treatment. Then he called again.
      This time neither the electric bell, nor the little brass knocker, caused
      the door to be opened. At the entrance to the Mansions he met the porter,
      who told him that Lady Phayre had locked up her flat for six months, and
      had gone to the south of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, and then only, did Goddard realise his lost paradise. He had been
      buoyed up with hopes that if he could but have speech with her he could
      win his pardon, his right of entry into the bit-over of Eden that she
      inhabited. Now she had closed the gates. If the porter had been the angel
      of the flaming sword, Goddard could not have looked at him with more
      hopeless acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered for some time aimlessly through the streets. Life seemed as
      drear as the murky November afternoon that was merging into a wet, dismal
      night. He had finished his routine duties for the day, had hurried through
      them feverishly in view of his visit to Lady Phayre. He walked on to
      Piccadilly Circus. There he stopped, debated for a moment what he should
      do. A Bayswater &rsquo;bus had just drawn up at the end of the lumbering
      line, and the conductor was vociferating loudly. He shouted into Goddard&rsquo;s
      face&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then! Nottin&rsquo; &rsquo;Ill, sir. Room inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goddard turned away quickly. He could not go home. The thought of Lizzie,
      foul and drunken, caused a red cloud to pass before his eyes. In his
      present mood it would be well not to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his way to his club, mounted to the quiet library, where he would
      be undisturbed by the chatter of acquaintances, and pulling up an
      arm-chair before a fire-place in a dark corner, gave himself up to the
      grim task of reconstructing his life. A new devastating element had come
      into his sphere&mdash;Lizzie. In the days before his friendship with Lady
      Phayre his wife had counted for little in his earnest life. He regretted
      her unhappiness, did what lay in his power to remedy the irremediable
      mistake of his marriage; but never desiring freedom, the bond scarcely
      troubled him. Even during the sweetness of his intercourse with Lady
      Phayre it had galled him but little. She was so far above him, the
      feelings with which he regarded her were so new to his almost original
      experience that he had not realised that he loved her after the common way
      of men. In the serenity of Lady Phayre&rsquo;s atmosphere Lizzie counted for no
      more than the little bare top-room in which he had once lived, his early
      memories of hardship and struggle with poverty. But now when the idyll was
      over, when he felt the man&rsquo;s fierce passion for the woman that was lost to
      him, the other woman who stood between counted as a terrible, resistless
      force.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed with set features into the fire. It faded, and in its place rose
      the scene of that night when the two women had met. One face noble,
      intellectual, pure in outline; the other, sodden, coarse, and bestial. He
      gripped the arms of his chair, and a half groan came from his lips. A
      loathing of the woman to whom he was bound arose within him like a nausea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then anger shook him&mdash;anger at the folly of his marriage; anger at
      the coarse nature of his wife, at her father&rsquo;s drunkenness, at the pretty
      baby face that had caught his raw fancy&mdash;anger, too, at Lady Phayre.
      Why had she sought him out? Why had she lured him on to enslave himself to
      her? Anger at her scorn of him, at her fine-lady sensitiveness that was
      revolted at the sight of a drunken shrew. Anger at her having led him into
      the fool&rsquo;s paradise only to eject him ignominiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight tap on his shoulder aroused him. He started round: the anger that
      was hot within him turned against the disturber. It was Gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been looking round the club for some one to dine with. Come
      along,&rdquo; he said in his friendly way.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Goddard glowered at him. At that moment Gleam seemed to belong to the
      other side of the great gulf, and he hated him with the old class-hatred.
      He looked so spick and span with his evening dress, and gold eye-glass,
      and meticulously trimmed head. His manner was so easy, giving the
      impression of freedom from sordid cares. He had no foul drunken wife
      dragging him down. He could meet Lady Phayre on a level. He could offer
      her marriage, and she could but take the offer as a compliment. A sense of
      personal degradation filled Goddard&rsquo;s soul, and he hated himself for
      hating Gleam. In a moment, however, he came to his senses, but not before
      Gleam had rallied him on his confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caught you napping, eh? Well&mdash;will you dine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Goddard, rising from his chair. &ldquo;Not to-night. I ought to have
      got out of this half-an-hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a pretence of stretching himself as if he had been asleep. Gleam
      looked at him with his quick glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been overworking yourself. Take care. You great strong men break
      with a crash. Go away and have a rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Lady Phayre,&rdquo; said Goddard, in the bitterness of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. That confounded strike of yours did for her. What the dickens
      we&rsquo;re to do without her I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life will go on just the same, I suppose. No one is indispensable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed mirthlessly. A faint flush rose in Gleam&rsquo;s dry cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking treason, Goddard. You certainly do want a rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One wants a devil of a lot of things one can&rsquo;t get,&rdquo; said Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want my dinner, and I&rsquo;m going to get it,&rdquo; replied Gleam
      good-humouredly. &ldquo;Goodbye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out of the library, took his place in the lift. His eyes twinkled,
      and he smoothed his moustache abstractedly. Then a little exclamation
      broke from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you speak, sir?&rdquo; said the lift-porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; replied Gleam. &ldquo;Yes; I wonder&mdash;I wonder why I have come down to
      the basement when I wanted the dining-room floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Goddard could not sit any longer in the library. The brooding spell
      was over, and its place was taken by feverish unrest. He left the Club,
      went out into the streets, and began to walk rapidly. Whither was he
      going? He did not care. A vague idea that he could free himself of his
      madness by physical exercise prompted him. He had a faint recollection of
      a scene in a penny dreadful read in his board-school days&mdash;a scene
      where the hero, to bring calmness to his throbbing brain, mounted his
      horse and galloped at whirlwind speed over miles and miles of moorland, in
      frenzied chase, until the noble animal&rsquo;s heart burst and he staggered and
      fell, throwing his rider, who broke his neck. But Goddard walked&mdash;up
      the hurrying Strand and Fleet Street, through the fast-emptying City;
      eastwards, up Fenchurch Street, the Whitechapel Road, Mile End Road,
      jostling through the crowded thoroughfares that reeked with the odour of
      fried-fish, naphtha from costers&rsquo; barrows, and the day&rsquo;s sweat of the
      toiling population; down Whitehouse Lane and Stepney High Street on to
      Ratcliffe Highway. The squalor and misery of it all touched the
      ever-responsive chord in his nature, awoke the demagogue in him to
      sympathy with the people. The East End had never appeared to him so
      terrible, so crushing in its vast unloveliness. Mile after mile it was
      just the same&mdash;the same stench, the same stunted men; the same anemic
      girl-mothers; the same foul, fringed, and feathered women of the street;
      the same bestial talk that seemed to hang continuously on the air; the
      same scenes of drunken brawling outside the public-houses; the same
      dreamy, endless tram-cars, smoothly gliding past this hubbub and swelter
      of humanity on the pavement; and everywhere the same joyless struggle for
      the four sole ends of life&mdash;food, raiment, shelter, and
      forgetfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard felt a strange and stern comfort in steeping his soul in these
      wide waters of bitterness. He went on and on, through brawling companies
      of sailors, swarthy Lascars, and the land-scum that clings round the
      seafaring life; past evil-smelling marine stores, live-stock dealers
      dissonant with the screeching of parrots, slop-shops, low eating-houses,
      scented from afar, even through the general stench, by the miasmic
      exhalations from basement gratings. At the end of the Highway he turned,
      retraced his steps, went through the foul river-side slums, crossed the
      Commercial Road, struck northwards, up dark, narrow streets, where the
      flare and turmoil of the great arteries were perceived but faintly, and
      the minor privacies of life were in sordid evidence. Through streets of
      sweaters&rsquo; dens he could see the vague forms of the workers behind the
      blindless windows. Once he stopped and counted&mdash;thirty in one small,
      gas-lit room.
    </p>
    <p>
      To carry on the combat with the powers of evil that enthralled this
      hideous city, his life needed little reconstruction. He thought of Lady
      Phayre, clenched his stick, and swung it furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go on with my work, and she can go to the devil!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he walked on through the endless streets.
    </p>
    <p>

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a simple way to rid ourselves of burdens, to consign them to
      Avernus, and ship them on the waters of Lethe. Unfortunately it is not
      always successful. They are apt to be elusive, like the vampire in the
      Indian story which Vikram could not keep in his sack. They slip from the
      hold of the dark ship, and return to the shoulders of the consigner. But
      in this Goddard&rsquo;s pride allowed no confession of failure. He blustered
      himself into the belief that Lady Phayre was no more to him than Hecuba
      was to the First Player, thus playing the hypocrite to himself with morose
      and stubborn futility. He plunged into his work with redoubled energy,
      grew angry when he found that it did not give him the old sufficing
      happiness, and obstinately refused to allow the simple, obvious cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the new element of discord in his life had to be accepted and
      harmonised. Lizzie was going from bad to worse. He brought Emily to live
      in the house to take permanent charge of her. Together they tried to
      mitigate the evil, to circumvent her in her plans for obtaining drink; but
      she was more than their equal in cunning. The disease had laid its
      everlasting grasp upon her. She sank daily in degradation. Daniel could
      not cheat himself into the fancy of freedom from this burden of loathing.
      Yet he was a man with a keen sense of justice. The more his heart
      revolted, the more doggedly did he repress outward manifestation. He bore
      her reproaches silently, strove to render her lot less bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re an angel from heaven, Daniel,&rdquo; said Emily once. She
      always had looked up to him with reverential adoration. &ldquo;How you can put
      up with her I don&rsquo;t know. You&rsquo;re a living angel if ever there was one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so, do you, Em?&rdquo; he answered with a rough laugh, rather
      touched. &ldquo;Well, go on thinking so. It won&rsquo;t do me any harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only once did Lizzie refer to the night of Lady Phayre&rsquo;s visit. It was a
      Sunday evening. Emily had gone to church, and had left the two together in
      the drawing-room. Daniel was smoking a pipe over a book, and Lizzie was
      engaged with some needlework&mdash;a rare occupation. She had been less
      fretful that day, had even asked him to sit with her. Gradually, as Daniel
      read, her efforts with her needle became spasmodic. There were intervals
      of gazing into the fire, and sudden resumptions of industry. Then she
      rose, moved about the room, idly examining nicknacks and fidgeting with
      furniture. At last she left the room, and entered her bedroom that
      adjoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Daniel&rsquo;s attention was arrested by a sharp tinkling sound. He
      started to his feet and went quickly to join Lizzie. It was as he had
      suspected. By the half-light of the dim-burning gas he saw her thrusting a
      bottle beneath some garments in a trunk. A glass half full of spirits was
      close by on the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lizzie! How can you?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned upon him in a fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you come in here! How dare you spy upon me! If I want to drink
      I&rsquo;ll drink. What business is it of yours if I kill myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seized the glass, had already put it to her lips, when he strode
      forward and dashed it from her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do it to-night anyhow, Lizzie,&rdquo; he said calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke into a torrent of angry speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the drink or passion was upon her, she used the vernacular of the
      Sunington streets&mdash;of her own home, for the matter of that. He waited
      until there was a lull in the tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the bottle anyway,&rdquo; he said, turning to the trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was the signal for a fresh outburst. She sat upon the trunk,
      swore he should never have it while she lived, prepared to defend her
      property by physical means. Goddard shrugged his shoulders, and sat down
      upon the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she burst into hysterical sobbing. She wished she was dead. She hated
      him. He was a brute. That was all he lived for&mdash;to keep the spy upon
      her when he wasn&rsquo;t making up to other women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m a fool?&rdquo; she cried, suddenly taking her hands from her
      face and turning to him. &ldquo;Do you think I don&rsquo;t know? I don&rsquo;t interfere
      with you: why should you interfere with me? Only don&rsquo;t bring your women to
      this house. Do you think I don&rsquo;t know your goings on? You are worse than I
      am. I don&rsquo;t pretend. You are a dirty blackguard. You think I don&rsquo;t know
      all about your Rhodanthes and things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started as if she had struck him, for a moment lost the command over
      himself that he had maintained through all the ordure of words. He
      regained it with a violent effort, clutching the counterpane fiercely,
      until his finger-nails were turned back. He understood now how a man could
      beat a woman. If he lost the hold over himself, he would rush to her and
      beat her&mdash;beat her until she lay senseless. Perhaps she almost
      expected it, for she paused at the last words, and looked at him
      half-coweringly, half-defiantly. So their eyes remained fixed on one
      another in the dim-lit room. Then she shuddered with body and lips, and
      uttering a low cry hid her face. A terror had taken possession of her. She
      was conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel rose from the bed, went to her, and took her by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go into the next room,&rdquo; he said sternly, and she obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He joined her after he had disposed of the disputed whisky-bottle. And
      there they sat in an appalling silence, until Emily came back from church,
      and relieved him of his charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the last time that Lizzie referred to Lady Phayre. He wondered
      how she had learned her name&mdash;that name Rhodanthe, which he had ever
      in his mind&mdash;which, save this once, he had never heard uttered aloud.
      It was a curious freak of fate&rsquo;s irony that, on this one occasion, it
      should have been uttered by his wife&rsquo;s lips. The circumstance embittered
      him still more against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks after this the long-expected vacancy in the Hough division
      occurred, and Goddard was definitely chosen as the Radical candidate. In
      the very beginning of his electoral campaign he received news from London
      that the terrible drink illness had fallen upon his wife.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII&mdash;A LEADER OF MEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;D</span> O YOU think it
      wise for me to go in?&rdquo; asked Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been asking for you,&rdquo; said the nurse. &ldquo;It may do her good; but
      don&rsquo;t speak to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she has definitely turned the corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; at last. But her recovery depends upon absolute quiet. It is the
      heart now. A sudden excitement, and then&rdquo;&mdash;she snapped her fingers&mdash;&ldquo;syncope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say&mdash;sudden death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall merely sit by her side for ten minutes,&rdquo; said Daniel. &ldquo;You are
      sure it will please her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a sign of forgiveness,&rdquo; said the nurse. She sighed. &ldquo;Ah! poor
      thing! I&rsquo;ll go and prepare her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goddard sat down wearily in the stiffly furnished drawing-room to await
      his summons, and rested his head in his hands. He was very tired. The
      strain, mental and physical, of the past three months had told upon him.
      His face was worn and yellow, and his eyes were rather too bright for
      health. A strange thing for him, he had been driven to seek medical advice
      for insomnia. The prescription was immediate rest and change. He shrugged
      his shoulders. After the election, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intense political feeling prevailed in the division. Goddard&rsquo;s influence
      was such as to leave none lukewarm. The conflict was raging fiercely. One
      of the heaviest polls on record was anticipated. The strain of candidature
      would have been great in ordinary circumstances. Coming as it did upon an
      already over-worked man, it was dangerous. And then there was Lizzie&rsquo;s
      illness. He had already come to town several times to satisfy himself that
      all was being done for her that money and skill could accomplish. It had
      been a matter of feverish anxiety lest any act of omission on his part
      should endanger her recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat with his head in his hands, staring at the pattern of the carpet,
      too tired to think coherently. To-morrow was polling day. He would have to
      get back that evening. By the registers he ought to get in. &ldquo;Daniel
      Goddard, M.P.&rdquo;&mdash;a name to conjure with in a few years&rsquo; time. And yet
      there was something missing. He knew what it was only too well. It might
      have been. He would have seen her in Hough to-morrow&mdash;eager, radiant,
      driving about the polling-booths, wearing his colours. And if he won&mdash;the
      joy of standing before her in his victory! But the other picture rose up
      before him. All through the election he had been haunted by the two women.
      He had wrestled with passionate desires. One night, when news had come
      that Lizzie lay between life and death, a horrible, overwhelming longing
      that she might die had kept him awake till the morning, when he rose and
      took the first train to town, to assure himself that no stone was being
      left unturned in order to save her. He remembered now some of Emily&rsquo;s
      descriptions of the horrors of that bed-side, and he shivered. Thank God
      it was over. She wanted to see him. Perhaps this might mark a change in
      their lives. He wondered whether she knew anything of the election.
      Perhaps she might take a pride in being the wife of a Member of
      Parliament. But what good could it do her? It would not bring fresh
      interests into her life. Yes, it was hopeless. Any common woman in the
      street would be as fit a companion for him. And again the longing for the
      companionship he had lost came upon him, and his thoughts, in his weary
      mood, lingered over the witchery of her odd name&mdash;Rhodanthe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr. Goddard,&rdquo; said the nurse, coming
      in. &ldquo;There were some odds and ends to do in the room. You&rsquo;ll be very, very
      quiet, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure there is no danger?&rdquo; asked Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse smiled at his insistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to her or make her talk. That is all,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goddard entered the sick-room on tiptoe. At the door Emily met him on her
      way out, and whispered a caution not to stay too long. He went to the
      bedside. Lizzie was lying very still and white. The flesh had left her
      cheeks; they were pinched, her features sharp, the skin drawn away tight
      against the bones. Her colourless lips hung loose; her teeth were
      prominent&mdash;a death&rsquo;s head rather than a living woman. Goddard was
      shocked to the heart. He scarcely recognised her. Not only did he fail to
      see in her any traces of the girl he had once thought to love, but also
      she was no longer the woman he had hated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; she whispered, moving a feeble hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it in his, tried to smile to reassure her. Her lips moved again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you kiss me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice had not changed. It lessened the strange sense of unfamiliarity
      with which he had been regarding her. There was an involuntary touch of
      peevishness in the tone. He bent down and kissed her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make haste and get well, Lizzie,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed satisfied with this, for she half closed her eyes, and let her
      hand slip from his on to the counterpane. Daniel sat down in the chair
      facing the small table by the bedside, on which were a bottle of medicine
      and glass, a bunch of violets in water, and her Bible. This last was a
      beautifully bound volume, edged with brass, and closed with a heavy clasp.
      Daniel had given it to her in the early days of their marriage, when she
      was eager to surround herself with all the obvious essentials of
      gentility. He had learned lately from Emily&rsquo;s chatter how she had insisted
      upon this Bible being placed near her. &ldquo;As if the Holy Book could charm
      away the other things,&rdquo; Emily had said in an awed tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of it carried his thoughts back. Only once before had he sat by
      her side like this&mdash;in this very room, too. She had been very white
      and still then, but young and fresh, with gladness in her eyes that had
      awakened within him an answering thrill. And there had been a little wee
      pink thing at her breast. It had fluffy black down on its head, he
      remembered. In this room, too, it had died three years later of
      diphtheria. The room&rsquo;s associations grew upon him. It was here that he had
      first come by the knowledge of the curse of her life. She was lying
      speechless one evening on the bed. He had bent over her unsuspectingly,
      and then started back with a horrible spasm of disgust. Involuntarily now
      he raised his head and looked at her. Her eyes were open, staring at the
      ceiling. His fancy seemed to read in them the lingering horrors through
      which she had passed. He shuddered, thanked God that the child had died.
      The hereditary poison must have lurked in its young veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      To shake off these thoughts he rose, stirred the fire into a blaze, and
      returned to his seat. Then, moved by compunction&mdash;for this was a
      visit of forgiveness&mdash;he stretched out his arm and smoothed the back
      of her hand. A look of gratefulness appeared on her face, and she closed
      her eyes again. Daniel&rsquo;s heart softened a little towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes passed slowly. He grew restless, wished that the nurse or
      Emily would come and relieve him. A sick-room, where one has to sit
      perfectly still, is not the place for a man suffering from nervous
      excitement. His eyes fell again on the Bible. He had not seen his gift for
      years. There was a certain pathos in her desire to have it near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it up, undid the clasp, and looked at the fly-leaf. &ldquo;To my dear
      wife.&rdquo; He sighed. He had tried to delude himself in those days that he
      loved her. Could he ever write such an inscription again? He shook his
      head, as the ever-haunting face of the other woman came between his eyes
      and the leaf. He turned the pages. They fell open, naturally, where a
      letter had been placed. The back of the envelope was turned to him. He
      thought it was one of his own to his wife, and felt touched by the idea of
      her keeping it there. He took it up curiously, but as his glance fell on
      the address he started with great amazement. It was in Lady Phayre&rsquo;s
      handwriting&mdash;bore only his name. It had been opened. He himself
      surely had never received such a letter. With heart furiously beating and
      trembling fingers, he drew out the enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Go, my hero and leader of men, to your victory. And if you love me,
      come back to me for your reward&mdash;whatsoever your heart desireth. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rhodanthe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments he remained staring at the paper, unable to comprehend.
      Then the truth crashed down upon him&mdash;both the letter&rsquo;s significance
      and the probable history of its miscarriage. His brain reeled. She loved
      him. The note of passion in the words drowned his senses like a great
      diapason. She loved him. But for this other woman she would be his. He
      rose from his chair, turning his back to his wife, and put his hand to his
      forehead. His instinct was to fly from her presence. The smouldering
      hatred had sprung into fierce flame. He made a few steps by the foot of
      the bed, then stopped and looked at her. Their eyes met. He saw that she
      had been following his movements from the time he had first opened the
      Bible. A wave of gathering madness clouded his brain, surged red before
      his eyes. Remaining sanity bade him rush from the room if she was to live.
      An explosion of his passion would kill her. But the expression of
      excitement and fear on her peaked, livid face read in his disordered brain
      as one of mocking triumph. It swept away the lingering self-control. He
      strode round to her side, lifted his arms above his head, clenching the
      letter and shaking with passion, let loose all the fury in his soul in a
      low, hoarse cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie rose to a sitting posture, gazed at him for a moment, an awful
      terror in her eyes, and then, with a gasp, fell back on her pillow&mdash;dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long he stood there, as if petrified, he never knew. When he recovered
      reason he wiped the great drops of perspiration from his forehead, thrust
      the letter into his pocket, and rushed from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emily! Nurse!&rdquo; he shouted from the top of the landing; and when they
      appeared hurriedly from the dining-room, &ldquo;Come up at once: I think Lizzie
      is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The women ran up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to her. I will fetch Dr. Carson,&rdquo; he cried, brushing past them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught up a hat from the hall, and in another moment was out of doors.
      This pretext for absence and solitude was an inspiration. She was dead. He
      was free. He had killed her. He did not notice that an icy, heavy rain was
      sweeping the streets. He had killed her for Rhodanthe. Rhodanthe was his:
      he had bought her with his soul. He bit his lips to prevent himself from
      crying aloud. The rare passers-by turned round scared at his wild face and
      furious gait.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calm of the doctor&rsquo;s waiting-room was a check, and allowed him to
      concentrate his scattered faculties. When the medical man appeared, alert
      and matter of fact, he was master of himself. He explained his errand. He
      had been sitting with his wife, had idly reached for her Bible by the
      bedside. She had sprang up to prevent him. The exertion had killed her. He
      had looked through the Bible, found a letter written to him which she had
      guarded through jealousy. The explanation was simple and satisfactory, yet
      he felt deadly faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are upset,&rdquo; said Dr. Carson, who had known him for several years.
      &ldquo;You have been burning the candle at both ends lately. Drink this while I
      go and put on my coat.&rdquo; He poured him out a glass of brandy, which he took
      from a cupboard. Goddard gulped it down neat. The spirit saved him from
      the threatening collapse and braced his nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accompanied the doctor to his own house in silence, left him at the
      dining-room door to go upstairs to the bedroom, and entering, sat down to
      wait. When the doctor returned, it was with a great effort that Goddard
      compelled himself to look him in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid your wife is dead,&rdquo; said the doctor gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am indirectly the cause,&rdquo; said Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other moved a deprecating hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that add to your sadness.
      Any other chance accident might have done it. Besides, may I speak to you
      frankly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;if it will not pain you&mdash;it is better so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would she never have recovered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her health was shattered. In all probability she would have broken out
      again. She and you have been spared some years of certain misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have done a good action from a philosophical point of view?&rdquo; said
      Goddard, with a harsh laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you put it that way, you have,&rdquo; replied he doctor, somewhat stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Carson,&rdquo; cried Goddard excitedly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that I am
      grieved she had gone. Don&rsquo;t expect me to play the hypocrite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect nothing but the misfortune of having you upon my hands in a
      short time,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me speak to you once and for all&mdash;as a medical man: I must
      speak to somebody. These last few weeks I have been in hell fire. I hated
      her. I wanted her to die. I used to wake up at nights wet through with
      sweat, through the terror of it. I have been to blame throughout from the
      first cursed day I married her. I didn&rsquo;t love her; she didn&rsquo;t care much
      for me. I had to go my way: she couldn&rsquo;t follow me. How could she? She was
      left alone here all by herself&mdash;no company, no occupations&mdash;nothing.
      You know her history&mdash;her father. The drink was in her blood. I tried
      to save her&mdash;after my fashion. You, who have attended her for the
      last eight years, can bear me out. But we were strangers&mdash;not an
      impulse in common. Latterly&mdash;listen: I must tell some one once, or I
      shall go mad. I knew what a woman could be&mdash;what it was to want a
      woman passionately, madly. She came here one night, discovered I was
      married&mdash;saw my wife drunk in this room. Since then my wife has been
      like an incubus throttling me, dragging me down to damnation. And I wanted
      her to die. In that room upstairs, an hour ago, when I kissed her and
      forgave her, I wanted her to die. When the moment came it was as though I
      had murdered her. Tell me, what am I to think? What am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His features were working strangely, his brow damp with the black hair
      straggling across it. He looked at Carson with a searching appeal in his
      eyes. The latter took his hand, felt his pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you are to do,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is to go to bed at once and sleep. I&rsquo;ll
      send you round a draught. What you are to think, when you wake up, is that
      you are not responsible for her death&mdash;that she might have died at
      any moment, that it is better to die than to live a life of misery; that
      you are a free man, young, with all that makes life worth living in front
      of you. And lastly, if you like, that I have forgotten all you have told
      me. Now, go to bed and stay there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; cried Goddard. &ldquo;The election.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the election!&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go back to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the arrangements,&rdquo; replied Goddard with a shiver. &ldquo;To-day is
      Tuesday. It will be for Friday. The poll will be declared at latest on
      Thursday morning. I must be there. Man alive!&rdquo; he cried, with a queer
      tremor in his voice. &ldquo;I cannot stay in this house! It would drive me mad.
      To sit here doing nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;only thinking. I must go
      back. It will occupy my mind. There are two women in this house&mdash;the
      dead one who is living, and the living one who is dead&mdash;has been dead
      to me. If ever action and stimulus have been necessary to me, they are
      imperative now. I must do it, man, I tell you&mdash;I must do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to walk about the room in a state of restless excitement, now and
      then moistening his lips with his tongue, and passing his hand through his
      hair. Dr. Carson reasoned with him. He was a young man, and felt himself
      powerless before Goddard&rsquo;s stronger personality. By virtue of mere
      professional prestige you cannot force a man to follow your prescriptions.
      Goddard impetuously swept aside his arguments. At last he stopped short,
      as if struck by a sudden inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what, Carson, I&rsquo;ll promise to start at once for the south of
      France, as soon as this miserable business is over, and not do a stroke of
      work for a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only sensible thing you have said to-day,&rdquo; returned the other,
      more cheerily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better let me see you again before you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They parted. Goddard stumbled heavily upstairs to his own room, threw
      himself on the bed, and lay there, holding his burning head in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Emily sat in the death-chamber and cried, the only soul on the wide
      earth who had love for the poor, wrecked creature that was dead, for
      Sophie, her sister, had never had a word of good to say on Lizzie&rsquo;s
      behalf. She alone knew and pitied the miserable tragedy of that poor,
      futile life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Paris-Lyons
      express was speeding through the darkness. It was intensely cold. The two
      other occupants of the carriage were shiveringly asleep beneath their
      rugs. But Goddard was awake, tinglingly awake, yet unconscious of external
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was passing through one of those rare epochs in life when a man feels
      himself to be master of his fate. Ever since he had seen the Dover Cliffs
      fading out of sight, and with them the last troubling impressions of a
      late graveside, he had been strung with a sense of invincibility. Nothing
      in his life that he had ardently desired had not been accomplished. He had
      but to will a thing, and it was done. He had conquered his position, step
      by step, with never a failure&mdash;his reputation as a popular leader,
      his responsible position in the Progressive League, his seat on the London
      County Council, his standing as an economic writer, his prestige at
      Ecclesby, and now his seat in Parliament. He had been returned by a
      triumphant majority. The victory intoxicated him&mdash;that and the
      elation of freedom. In his exalted mood he saw himself lifted above the
      moral conventions of men. The death of his wife seemed a part of his
      destiny of victory. He had scarcely been responsible. Blind fate had
      helped him, as it had done hitherto.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he was on his way to the most glorious conquest of all. Every
      moment was bringing him nearer. To-morrow he would see Lady Phayre. His
      arms would be about her. She would yield herself to him. The new life
      would begin&mdash;great, glorious, wonderful. With her by his side there
      would be nothing impossible. The whole world should bless his name. He
      would make history. He would go down to posterity as the Great Demagogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would put her white arms about his neck, and her lips would cling to
      his. When the thought came, a flash of passion irradiated the whole man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never doubted that he would win her. She loved him. The letter which he
      had read over a thousand times was overwhelming evidence. Her hurried
      flight from London also testified to the seriousness of the blow the
      discovery had been to her. He conjured up scenes and incidents in their
      past intercourse whose significance, unnoticed at the time, became sweetly
      plain in the light of his new knowledge. Nothing could stand in his way
      now. He was going to her, not a broken man humiliated with failure, as he
      had done on the last occasion he had sought her, but proud with name and
      fame, and the promise of great power in the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not written to her. His imagination was too much fired with the
      idea he had conceived of bursting upon her suddenly with the news of his
      freedom and with a passionate appeal. The vividness and excitement of the
      past few days had awakened the theatrical element in his nature&mdash;the
      dramatic instinct that lies in the nature of any great orator and leader
      of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Lyons, dix minutes d&rsquo;arrêt!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goddard left the compartment to stretch his legs. The great station loomed
      vast in the darkness of the mid-January morning. The tapping of the wheels
      echoed ghostly in the stillness. Only a few muffled forms had braved the
      cold, and were stamping their feet on the platform, or hurrying to the
      dimly lit buffet for the morning coffee. Nothing more delicious than this
      in the sweet spring dawn, but at five o&rsquo;clock in mid-winter it requires an
      effort to leave the snugness of the compartment. To Goddard the journey
      was half dream, half delight. The great train, standing, to his English
      eyes, monstrously high above the rails, seemed some strange engine
      appointed by fate to his service. It seemed symbolic of the irresistible
      force that he had at his command.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the train started again he tried to sleep, but his brain was too
      excited. He had not slept for three nights. Yet the feelings of
      prostration that had come upon him just before Lizzie&rsquo;s death had passed
      away, giving place to one of intense vitality. Every fibre in his body was
      alive. Sleep was scarcely necessary. Only a shooting pain now and then in
      his head made him start and pass his hand impatiently across his forehead.
      The train thundered on through the darkness, and Goddard remained awake,
      possessed by the passionate intensity of his fixed idea. He watched the
      day dawn, bright and glorious. At Avignon the world was bathed in
      sunshine. It was an omen of happiness. At Marseilles it was hot. All along
      that beautiful coast Goddard&rsquo;s heart glowed within him. The deep-coloured
      sea, the flowers, the light, the joyousness of the south filled his senses
      with the wonder of a new world. His silent companions got out at Toulon,
      and three swarthy Gascons took their place, and talked with rich deep
      voices and extravagant gestures until they reached Camoules, their
      destination. Goddard missed their whole-hearted laughter when they had
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day wore on. Cannes at four o&rsquo;clock. In a few moments he would be in
      Nice. He drew once more the letter from his pocket, rested his eyes on the
      few words a long, long time. &ldquo;Whatsoever your heart desireth&mdash;
Rhodanthe.&rdquo;
       He looked out at the deep blue water meeting the violet sky. Rhodanthe!
      The name was strangely in harmony with this exotic beauty. Before the
      night was over he would call her by it. She would be his. Together they
      would conquer the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped on to the platform at Nice like a king coming to take
      possession of a new realm. He looked around, as if he should see Lady
      Phayre awaiting him, and then smiled at the fancy. The hotel porter took
      his luggage to the Hôtel Terminus, the nearest. He was feverishly anxious
      to set out on his quest of her without loss of time. A quarter of an hour
      sufficed him to wash and make himself presentable, and then he went out
      into the Avenue de la Gare. At another time he would have loved to walk
      down the beautiful boulevard, bright with shops and cafés and gaily
      coloured kiosques; but now the supreme hour of his life had come, and the
      great thoroughfare became blurred as in a dream. He hailed a cab, gave the
      address &ldquo;Hôtel des Anglais&rdquo; to the driver, and sat bolt upright all the
      way, in an agony of impatience. He had no eyes now for the sea as he
      emerged on to the Promenade des Anglais; but he scanned the long line of
      palace-hotels, wondering which was Lady Phayre&rsquo;s. The cab stopped by the
      public gardens. Goddard looked up. It was the Hôtel des Anglais. He threw
      a piece of money to the cabman, and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frock-coated, brass-buttoned porter approached him in polite inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see Lady Phayre,&rdquo; said Goddard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid, sir,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;that Lady Phayre has gone away this
      very morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone away?&rdquo; asked Goddard, looking at him blankly. &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that I cannot say,&rdquo; said the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he added, with the benevolent smile of his class&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you have not heard, sir, that there is no longer such a person as
      Lady Phayre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Goddard. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that Madame was married this morning. It was to a Monsieur Gleam. I
      believe he is a member of Parliament. He has been staying in the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goddard stared at him with a ghastly face. He turned slowly and went down
      the hotel steps. He staggered a few yards. Then the sea, and the trees,
      and the great white palaces mingled together in a whirling circle, and
      disappeared in the blackness of night. Something in his brain seemed to
      snap, and he fell an inert mass on the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For weeks he lay ill. He recovered to wish that he had died. Despair
      overwhelmed him. His crime haunted him waking and sleeping. In his bodily
      prostration he seemed to hear the mocking laughter of the fiend that had
      prompted it. With the torture of remorse was paradoxically mingled
      impotent anger at the cynicism of fate. His soul sickened at the futility
      of things. He shrank with shuddering dismay from the ordeal that lay
      before him. There were times when death beckoned to him with tempting
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      But men of Goddard&rsquo;s stamp survive the shipwreck of their happiness. They
      live on, and go about the world&rsquo;s work doggedly, stubbornly, blindly
      obeying the fighting instinct within them. The great tragedies of the soul
      culminate not in death, but in dragging years of life, when the
      grasshopper is a burden and desire fails. And such is the end of Daniel
      Goddard&rsquo;s tragedy. He lives to-day. His name is a household word. He is
      the coming man, not of a party-clique, but of a nation. He has sat upon
      the Treasury Bench. In the next Liberal Administration he will hold
      Cabinet rank. He is envied, courted, flattered. The wildest ambitions of
      his boyhood are in course of certain fulfilment. But he has lost for ever
      the joy of victory; the springs of happiness are for ever closed by the
      one overwhelming defeat of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is on the best of terms with Aloysius Gleam, and attends his wife&rsquo;s
      dinner-parties. Between them the past has only once been referred to, and
      that silently. It was the first time he found himself alone with her, one
      evening after dinner, Gleam having been summoned from the drawing-room.
      Their eyes met for an embarrassing moment. Then Goddard drew the familiar
      letter from his pocket-book, held it out for a few seconds so as to catch
      her eye, and threw it into the fire. She watched it blaze, and gave two or
      three little nods of acknowledgment. Then, being in a comfortable chair, a
      bewitching costume, and a considerably relieved frame of mind, she allowed
      the moisture to gather in her eyes. But neither spoke until Gleam returned
      with a sprightly saying on his lips. He threw himself into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An old servant has just been to return me a sovereign she once stole. It
      weighed on her conscience. I asked her about a certain diamond pin. She
      looked haggard, and fled incontinently. Verily, all is for the funniest in
      this funniest of all possible worlds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhodanthe broke into her silvery laugh. Goddard joined in grimly and
      looked at her. For desire of her he had committed murder. He was laughing
      and jesting with her husband and herself. Gleam was right. It was the most
      humorous of worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his mind went back to the terrible moment of his life, and his heart
      gave a great heave, and his lips moved noiselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God, forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
